  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;Different Operating Systems use different characters as their path separator when specifying directory and file paths:
&lt;pre&gt;
foo/bar/baz    # *nix uses a /
foo\bar\baz    # Win32 uses a \
foo:bar:baz    # Mac OS 9 uses a :
foo/bar/baz    # Mac OS X uses a / (usually!)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Perl you can generally just use a / as your path separator (except on Mac OS 9, thanks [Hanamaki]). Why? Because Perl will &lt;b&gt;automagically&lt;/b&gt; convert the / to the correct path separator for the system it is running on! This means that coding Windows paths like this
&lt;pre&gt;$path = &quot;\\foo\\bar\\baz&quot;;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;is not required. You can just use this:
&lt;pre&gt;$path = &quot;/foo/bar/baz&quot;;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and things will be fine. In fact using \\ can be problematic, but you probably already know that :-)
&lt;p&gt;If you want to display the expected system delimiter to a user (ie hide the fact that you are using / internally) you can just do something like this:
&lt;code&gt;my $perl_path = '/foo/bar/baz';
(my $win_path = $perl_path) =~ tr!/!\\!;
print &quot;Perl still sees:  $perl_path\n&quot;;
print &quot;But we can print: $win_path\n&quot;;
&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you need to do lots of conversions just write a sub like this:
&lt;code&gt;my $perl_path = '/foo/bar/baz';
print &quot;This is the Windows path: &quot;, win_path($perl_path), &quot;\n&quot;;

sub win_path {
    (my $path = shift) =~ tr!/!\\!;
  return $path;
}
&lt;/code&gt;
So there you have it. Paths in Perl. By using a / you make it much easier to port your code to another system. For truly portable methods look into the [File::Spec] module (part of the standard distro) and [perlman:perlport]. Thanks to [wog] and [Hanamaki] for this suggestion. And if you have been converting / to \\ ....</doctext>

  <doctext>File input and output is not much of a stretch from normal I/O.
Basically you have to use the [perlfunc:open|open] command to open a
filestream and then read to and write from it.  Then once you're done
with it you use [perlfunc:close|close] to close the file. The syntax for
opening a file is: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
open(FILEHANDLE,&quot;filename&quot;);&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
This opens a new filehandle with the name of FILEHANDLE, and associates it with
filename which is the location of the file on your disk.  This works for
reading a file.  If you want to write to it you need to put a &gt; in front of
the filename as seen below:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
open(FILEHANDLE,&quot;&gt;filename&quot;);&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
To append to a file you use &gt;&gt; in front of the filename as you can see here:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
open(FILEHANDLE,&quot;&gt;&gt;filename&quot;);&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Now for some quick examples:&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CODE&gt;
open(FILE, &quot;data.txt&quot;);          #opens data.txt in read-mode
while(&lt;FILE&gt;){                   #reads line by line from FILE which is the filehandle for data.txt
   chomp;
   print &quot;Saw $_ in data.txt\n&quot;; #shows you what we have read
}
close FILE;                      #close the file.
&lt;/CODE&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
To print stuff to a file you merely through a line into your program like:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
print FILEHANDLE &quot;your text here\n&quot;;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
FILEHANDLE needs to be a FILEHANDLE you currently have open.  Notice there is no comma between the FILEHANDLE and the stuff your printing out.
  That is the way it needs to be.  Now for a more extended example:&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CODE&gt;
open FILE, &quot;&gt;keylogger.dat&quot;;  #opens file to be written to
while(&lt;&gt;){                    #while we're getting input from the keyboard
   print FILE $_;             #write it to our file
}
close FILE;                   #then close our file.
&lt;/CODE&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Another thing you might want to look into are the [perlfunc:_X|filetest operators] these allow
you to do things like test whether a file exists, is readable, is writable among other things.

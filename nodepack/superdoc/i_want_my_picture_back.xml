  <doctext>In the days of old anyone could link images from off-site and display them on their home nodes.  In an effort to honor users who have reached monk status or higher the privilege to have an image on your home node became reserved for these high ranking monks.
&lt;P&gt;However since we did not want to steal a privilege from those who had already taken advantage of this feature we allowed users to petition for this privilege.
These are the monks who petitioned and got their picture back:

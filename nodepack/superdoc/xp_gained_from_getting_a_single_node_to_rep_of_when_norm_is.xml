This table shows how much [id://5938|XP] you can expect to get
from a node you wrote, as its reputation rises.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The numbers along the top are the reputation of a node.
(This number fluctuates as other monks up-vote and down-vote the node.
You hope it only goes up!)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The numbers down the left side are $NORM, explained in [id://5938].
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For illustration purposes, look at the last row, where $NORM is 10.
If you have a node which has a reputation 21, you can expect that
you've gotten about 9 XP from that node. Of course, it's not accrued
to you all at once; XP from node rep is allotted as the node's rep
changes. And you may not have gotten &lt;i&gt;exactly&lt;/i&gt; 9 XP from that
node; perhaps the node has been around a while, and some of the
voting on it occurred when $NORM was 9.5, or even lower. In that
case, you may have gotten more than 9 XP from it.
&lt;/p&gt;

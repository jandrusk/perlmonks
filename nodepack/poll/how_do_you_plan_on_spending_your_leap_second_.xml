  <createtime>2005-12-26 02:05:25</createtime>
  <choices>Watching my life flash before my eyes.
Seeing how high I can count, &quot;One, Two, th&quot;
Considering all the Britney Spears songs I like.
Computing the answer to the universe on my new 3GHz dual-core system.
Procrastinating.
Watching the clock.
Catching up on my beauty sleep.
Stopping to smell the roses.
Trying to get the jump on everyone else at quick-posting an answer to PerlMonks.</choices>

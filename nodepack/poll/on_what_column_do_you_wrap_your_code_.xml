  <title>On what column do you wrap your code?</title>
  <createtime>2006-02-08 12:02:38</createtime>
  <choices>72  -- Doesn't everybody?
20  -- I use a Zaurus.
78  -- Isn't this the standard?
180 -- I have a wide screen!
120 -- Eighty chars just isn't enough.
Real programmers don't wrap their code.
64  -- Because its such a &lt;i&gt;nice&lt;/i&gt; number....
50  -- My wife won't let me upgrade my 15 inch monitor....
I never wrap two lines at the same column.
Aren't wraps something you eat for lunch?
80  -- 'Cause I &lt;u&gt;like&lt;/u&gt; to...
Wherever my boss says I have to.
79  -- Rank doth have its priviledges
I am a free spirit and wrap as I like when I like....</choices>

  <choices>All day long I'd biddy biddy bum.
I'd move the Monastery to an island paradise in the Carribbean and open the [gods]' swimming pool to everyone (shhh... except NodeReaper, for obvious reasons).
I'd buy the house next door to Bill and blast the Windows startup theme music every time I have to reboot.
I'd finally get rid of my Pentium-II.
I would fund a research project into building &lt;strike&gt;a better&lt;/strike&gt; the ultimate mousetrap.
I would still be &lt;em&gt;Just another Perl hacker,&lt;/em&gt;
Broadband for everyone! It's on me!
I would give the Chatterbox streaming video.
I would pay for Antivroom's therapy sessions.</choices>

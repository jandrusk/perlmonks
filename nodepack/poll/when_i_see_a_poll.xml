  <choices>I immediately vote for the last option
I usually read &quot;pool&quot; and dive in
I vote for the shortest answer, because it's easier to read, which pleases me very much
I pick an answer and vote for another
I vote for a random option
I either vote for the first or for the last option
I don't vote, I just comment
I immediately vote for the first option</choices>

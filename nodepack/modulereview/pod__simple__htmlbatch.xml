  <doctext>I went once around the block with a number of the
existing perl tools for pod to html processing, and I wrote 
up what I found: 
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://obsidianrook.com/devnotes/pod-html-summary.html&quot;&gt;Pod to Html&lt;/A&gt;. 
&lt;P&gt;

My goal was to find a simple way to extract the pod from a 
tree of multiple *.pm/*.pod files and convert it into 
a tree of html files.  And if you're nodding your head
saying &quot;Of course, that's so simple!&quot;, you probably haven't 
looked into this very closely. 
&lt;P&gt;

Summary: Pod::Html and pod2html are known to be very weak,
limited tools (and ditto pods2html, which is closer to what
I needed).  There are many alternative methods, none of
which have become standards as of yet.  My suggestion is to 
keep an eye on Sean M. Burke: his 
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://search.cpan.org/~sburke/Pod-Simple-3.02/lib/Pod/Simple/HTMLBatch.pm&quot;&gt;Pod::Simple::HTMLBatch&lt;/A&gt;
turned out to be almost exactly what I was looking for: it crunches the documentation for a tree of modules, and generates readable html, converting L&amp;lt;&amp;gt; links into 
relative html links. 
&lt;P&gt;

An honorable mention also goes to 
Mark Overmeer who looks like he's developing some interesting ideas with his 
&lt;A HREF=&quot;http://search.cpan.org/~markov/OODoc-0.90/lib/OODoc.pod&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;OODoc&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/A&gt;
(some custom extentions to pod markup to deal with large OO projects). 
&lt;P&gt;

By the way: it's a funny thing, but pod processing modules
almost always seem to have very sketchy pod...

  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;If you've been following the [http://www.pcworld.com/news/article/0,aid,112572,00.asp|news] as of late, [http://www.verisign.com|VeriSign] has decided to resolve all non-existent domain names to a service they set up called Site Finder in a scheme to take advantage of their monopoly as controllers of the .com and .net TLDs. This is particularly annoying for individuals who enjoy checking the validity of links (I send a header that is the same as what IE 6.0 would send). As is shown by the following link, if the domain name doesn't exist (expired or was entered by someone who just wanted to dump trash into your database) then it will return a valid page (after a 302 moved header): [http://www.lsadjflj.com/alksdjf/aldhgjh].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter [cpan://Acme::DNS::Correct] to correct this problem. It is designed as a drop-in replacement for [cpan://Net::DNS::Resolver]. If the ip for the Site Finder site is detected, the response will be cleansed of the offending ip. The only bug in this module is in the case where you actually wish to resolve sitefinder-idn.verisign.com.&lt;/p&gt;</doctext>

  <doctext>&lt;i&gt;[jeffa] steps up to the podium&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&amp;#91;feedback] testing ... is this thing on? &lt;i&gt;ahem&lt;/i&gt;.
Manipulating dates in Perl is a common task, and it's no
wonder that there are a plethora of date modules in the
[http://search.cpan.org/modlist/Data_and_Data_Types/Date|Date]
namespace. As you can see in the following Power Point slide
&amp;#91;show slide that makes the [http://bioperl.org/images/bioperl.pdf|Bioperl Class Diagram] look easy], determining which Date module to use
is quite a chore. All of that just to find a date. Enter 
[cpan://Acme::Current].
&lt;/p&gt;
Acme::Current seeks to &amp;#91;feedback] (can that be fixed?) ... anyhoo, it seeks to eliminate the complexity associated
with determining the current date. I installed the module
on my box yesterday, let's test it out:
&lt;code&gt;
use Acme::Current;
printf &quot;It's now %04d/%02d/%02d.\n&quot;,
    $Acme::Current::YEAR,
    $Acme::Current::MONTH,
    $Acme::Current::DAY
;
&lt;/code&gt;
And when run, this yields:
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
It's now 2003/07/15.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
Uh oh. Today is the 16th (is today the 16th?). Yes it appears to be the 16th. &amp;#91;shuffles notes] Ummmm.
&lt;small&gt;help&lt;/small&gt;. &amp;#91;shuffles notes ... feedback].
Aha! I forgot to update the module today! &amp;#91;installs
module again].
&lt;p&gt;
There, let's run that code again:
&lt;code&gt;
use Acme::Current;
printf &quot;It's now %04d/%02d/%02d.\n&quot;,
    $Acme::Current::YEAR,
    $Acme::Current::MONTH,
    $Acme::Current::DAY
;
&lt;/code&gt;
and we get the current date:
&lt;tt&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
It's now 2003/07/16.
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;
In conclusion, as long as you keep Acme::Current up to date
(a scheduled cron job should do the trick), Acme::Current
will keep you up to date with the current date ... as long
as you don't mind that date being GMT, or course. Thank
you.

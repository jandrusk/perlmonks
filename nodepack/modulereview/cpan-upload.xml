This is not a module, it's a script.
&lt;P&gt;
After going through most of my modules on CPAN to make sure that they will work on the soon to be Perl 5.8.1, I again realized that the low profile, but &lt;B&gt;very&lt;/B&gt; handy [http://search.cpan.org/author/NEILB/cpan-upload-2.2/cpan-upload|cpan-upload] utility script is a must-have for a module author.
&lt;P&gt;
What does it do?  Well, not a lot, but it does it quickly and quietly.  It uploads your files to CPAN as simple as:
&lt;pre&gt;
    cpan-upload Your-Module-1.07.tar.gz
&lt;/pre&gt;
You get your confirmation mails just the way as you would normally if you would upload files to CPAN &quot;manually&quot;.
&lt;P&gt;
What do you need to do?  Well, download it, then:
&lt;pre&gt;
perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install
&lt;/pre&gt;
then, in you home directory, create a file named &quot;.pause&quot; that you can only read and write to (-rw------), and put your configuration information in there.  This is usually very simple, such as:
&lt;pre&gt;
user CPANID
password xyuolskhj
mailto your@address.tld
&lt;/pre&gt;
and voila, you're set!
&lt;P&gt;
[http://search.cpan.org/author/NEILB/|Neil Bowers] has made a very nice utility script that is well documented.  Kudo's to Neil!

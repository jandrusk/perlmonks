&lt;blockquote cite=&quot;http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Carp::Clan&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you just want to ward off all error messages from the module in which you &#8220;&lt;code&gt;use Carp::Clan&lt;/code&gt;&#8221;, i.e., if you want to make all error messages or warnings to appear to originate from where your module was called (this is what you usually used to &#8220;&lt;code&gt;use Carp;&lt;/code&gt;&#8221; for &lt;tt&gt;;-)&lt;/tt&gt;), instead of in your module itself (which is what you can do with a &#8220;[doc://die]&#8221; or &#8220;[doc://warn]&#8221; anyway), you do not need to provide a pattern, the module will automatically provide the correct one for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I discovered this module, I would play silly games with &lt;code&gt;local $Carp::CarpLevel = $Carp::CarpLevel + 1&lt;/code&gt; sprinkled all over the place. Not only was that annoying, it also hatefully causes [doc://Carp] to emit verbose messages. Now I just &lt;code&gt;use Carp::Clan&lt;/code&gt; and things work as I meant them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that&#8217;s not the module&#8217;s only use &#8211; but that alone makes the module worthwhile to use everywhere, even if you don&#8217;t have a &#8220;clan&#8221; of modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only question is: why is this not part of the core? Why indeed doesn&#8217;t [doc://Carp] itself work that way?&lt;/p&gt;</doctext>

  <doctext>D&lt;b&gt;isclaimer: this review is preliminary.and will be extended
once I will get the hang of that much needed module.&lt;p&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

I don't know other HList CGI support. so this module is
most welcome.&lt;p&gt;

At first look the API is very clean. Keep It Simple.&lt;br&gt; 

flame bait: KIS is too rare in
the Perl world that delights too often on uneeded diversity and complexity, opening the road to languages
that suffer the oposite shortcoming: lacking versatility.&lt;p&gt;

But I immediately ran into a  major  disappointment, the bundled
demo was easily installed but failed to perform correctly
on browsers other than Internet Explorer. CGI::explorer due to the use of proprietary tags.
The module author is aware of it and will fix that.&lt;p&gt;.

  <doctext>&lt;P&gt;Review: CDB_File&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;P&gt;General Summary: Good, but limited applications&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;The CDB_File module allows you to gain access to databases
that are stored in the CDB format (by Dan Bernstein).&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;CDB_Files are very efficient when it comes to lookup
speed.  They are especially usefull when you have a large
data set.  The tradeoff is that CDB_Files are read-only.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If you want to update a CDB_File, you must pass a new 
hash of data to the CDB_File::create class method and then
re-tie your old tied hash to gain access to the new data.
This means if you are in a situation where you constantly
need to be both acessing and updating your data file, the
CDB_File format is probably not your best choice.&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In benchmarking of CDB_Files vs DB_Files, I found that 
there is a considerable ammount of overhead in the process
of tying a CDB_File vs. tying a regular DB_File, so if you
are forced into a situation where you are tying a data file,
accessing a single value, then un-tying, you may be better
off with a DB_File (especially if you have a small data
set)&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;P&gt;If however, you have a situation where you are tying
to a data file once, and doing multiple lookups with very
little updates, you might want to consider CDB_Files as 
a very useful alternative to DB_Files.&lt;/P&gt;</doctext>

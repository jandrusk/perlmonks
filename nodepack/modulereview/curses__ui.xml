  <doctext>I had to write a configuration utility for an embedded appliance that would not have a monitor attached to it. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
In looking around I found the Curses::UI module from CPAN. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The ability and power of this module is amazing it enabled me to create popup windows, textentry fields, radio button boxes, allow the user to read files. All from a serial console. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
This is done with a few simple instructions. 
Once you create the initial $cui object everything else ties into it. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
I was also able to easily break my code down into objects that were their own windows. From the driver code I am able to tell the objects to draw themselves and the correct page appears. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
This module has been invaluable in speeding up my development of a text base user interface to enable customers to configure these machines. I would encourage anyone who is working with a server that needs to setup a simple menu system to control your machine to investigate Curses::UI.

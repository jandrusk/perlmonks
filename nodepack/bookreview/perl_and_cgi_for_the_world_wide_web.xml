  <doctext>I know. I know. Its a Peach Pit Press book, and is regarded
by most as fodder. To boot, its barely 200 pages of actual
information and even then, its not in paragraph form.&lt;P&gt; 
Elizabeth Castro however does a very good job at getting to
the point, and fast. The book does a really good job of 
bringing up to speed the person that doesnt have a strong
background in programming but isnt intimidated by getting 
into very pragmatic examples.
I've followed up reading this book with other much thicker
and more in depth volumes, but I've found that reading them
goes much quicker with the base that I
got from Castro's book. So, I don't find myself getting mired
in very basic concepts and frustrated over the fact that I
still have 300 more pages to read.&lt;p&gt;
In short, Castro's book is for beginners, but for that group,
it really is a very, Quick Start.

  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;Before i got this book i sometimes wondered how to solve given &quot;sysadmin&quot; tasks and if this is possible (or manageable for me) in perl ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To make a long story short this book really gave me a boost and i could solve some problems in only 2 weeks which i was thinking and trying many times before ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the most valuable Perl books, i must admit that i cant say much on linux automation since i almost only use win32 automation in Perl, but &quot;only&quot; the suggested Modules that kept me from searching for days to find the right tool for the task are worth the money for the book. &lt;br&gt;The Examples could be adjusted to my needs, i did only read a few chapters but already got many useful information which helps me alot. (Event Log Parsing for example)&lt;br&gt;
I so far found only a few minor &quot;formatting&quot; typos that i was able to correct with warnings on ... &lt;br&gt;
Overall i blame myself not to have bought this book earlier it would have spared me many errors in windows administration, alone the navigation through the module jungle ...
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The only critics: That i would have liked more &quot;sample code&quot; on some for me more complicated topics like user management or WMI, here i would have expected a little more details it is again that i see the most hated sentence a writer could use &lt;b&gt;&quot;This is beyond the scope of this book&quot;&lt;/b&gt;. 
I think it could be a little better &quot;indexed&quot; sometimes i need too much time to find the right page in the book  ...
&lt;br&gt;Since i use Strawberry Perl and not Active Perl and cpan behind a firewall i had to do some work to get it run, would be fine if there would have been some tipps on using cpan with proxys/firewalls ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Book is not meant for the Beginner, so i have to do some basic work here and there since i am not a experienced programmer ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Reader feels that the author is a gifted sysadmin &lt;b&gt;sharing his wisdom from practical experience and writing is a pleasure for him&lt;/b&gt; ...&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;I would give this book a rating of 4 out of 5 stars&lt;/b&gt;, cause of small &quot;flaws&quot;&lt;br&gt;
(I never gave a book 5 stars, cause no one writes books or me only, but this is so far the most useful book for me on perl  ;-).)&lt;br&gt;
I may adjust the review as i read more ...&lt;br&gt;

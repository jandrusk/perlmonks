  <doctext>Since MySQL has become such a popular open source database, many programmers have flocked ( no pun intended ) to it. It combines a 'difficult to rival' feature set ( speed, stability, access to source code, programming interfaces, etc. ) at minimal or no cost. This text begins with a chapt. on installation ( win32 and *nix ) with an emphasis on a GUI set-up and CL. Virtually every aspect is explained carefully and throughly. From that point on, the chapts. are geared to more specific topics ( populating tables, performing operations on tables, etc. with SQL, etc. ). The valuable skill of database administration is covered as is the topic of securing an installation ( though not as completely as I would have liked ). If the reader does &lt;B&gt;not&lt;/B&gt; have prior experience with the structured query language ( SQL ), I highly suggest they read a book on the topic before attempting this one as the knowledge is assumed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
 
 Perhaps the most interesting topic deals with connecting to  your DB with C/C++, Perl, PHP, or Java ( chapt. 12-15 ). By this point in the text, you should able to populate, retrieve, manipulate, etc. the info in any table you have access to. Surely, a valuable skill. This is another 'jewel' from Wrox press.&lt;BR&gt;

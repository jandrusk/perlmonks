  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;This book was my first introduction to programming with Perl,  which is good and bad (the book, that is).  For a beginner,  I'd cautiously recommend it.  I was writing functional scripts almost immediatly with CGI 101.  I learned quite a bit from this book and it got me excited about perl, but it's lacking in major areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the good,  it is very accessible and full of code examples.  It does a good job describing regex to a complete beginner, has a short but good introduction to DBI and mySQL,  and you really could learn enough from this book to make some pretty good CGI sites. I still find myself referring to some of it's chapters,  specifically on date/time,  cookies, strings, and regex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On the bad,  it taught me bad programming style that I now have to unlearn.  She doesn't recommend using &quot; -wT&quot; in your scripts until the end of the book, and doesn't mention &quot;use strict&quot; at all (that I remember). This is especially a problem considering that I want to move a whole bunch of scripts into mod_perl, which is less forgiving with sloppy variables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm sure there are better books for beginners out there (I have the O'Reilly CGI Programming book).  However, CGI 101 got me excited very quickly about perl programming, which is a damn good thing. However, the bad programming style has hurt my coding somewhat.&lt;/p&gt;</doctext>

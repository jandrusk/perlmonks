  <doctext>Look at [id://21664|The Perl Cookbook], [id://21811|Advanced Perl Programming], and [id://99545|Perl for System Administration].  Also [id://22049|Perl CD Bookshelf Version 1].
&lt;p&gt;
Two thumbs up.  Five stars.  I &lt;i&gt;would&lt;/i&gt; eat here again!
&lt;p&gt;
This bad boy contains [isbn://1565922867|Perl in a Nutshell], [isbn://0596000278|Programming Perl 3rd Edition], [isbn://1565922433|Perl Cookbook], [isbn://1565922204|Advanced Perl Programming], &amp; [isbn://1565926099|Perl for System Administration] all on one cd.  Learning Perl and Learning Perl on Win32 Systems have been dropped from V1.  Camel is updated to the 3rd Edition.  Perl for System Administration has been added.  This CD also comes with a hardcopy of Perl In a Nutshell.
&lt;p&gt;
This cd saves about 30lbs. of books to haul about as one moves from home to school|office|travel.  Definitely worth the USD $79.95 / CAN $116.95.  Of course, one can pick it up from [http://www.fatbrain.com] at a nice discount.</doctext>

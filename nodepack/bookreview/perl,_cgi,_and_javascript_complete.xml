  <doctext>&lt;!-- footpad: Corrected ISBN (needs to be entered w/o spaces) and various typo's. --&gt;
This book takes the (seemingly) worst bits out of a few good books and hashes them together in a way which is out of date, boring and riddled with errors.
&lt;P&gt;
Seems to have no idea about use of 'strict' or CGI modules at all... although it does provide a handy reference at the back for Javascript and Perl.  The reference is its only shining light and that is muffled with a thick wadge of typo's even in the reference and code sections of the book.  I had to debug the first example before it would function and as this was my first foray into Perl, this was an interesting experience.
&lt;P&gt;
Has no idea about making use of Perl's features and repeats itself while claiming to provide code for a guestbook (doesn't work), counter (doesn't work) and I didn't bother with the log decoder examples because I &lt;B&gt;very&lt;/B&gt; much doubt if they work too!
&lt;P&gt;
Not a book for a beginner, intermediate or expert unless you need a reference section...&lt;BR&gt;
although man pages work for me

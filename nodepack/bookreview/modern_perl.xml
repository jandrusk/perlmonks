  <doctext>Its list of contents looks very promising to me. No matter who you are, a novice in Perl or an expert; this book has something new, interesting and informative contents for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

First three chapters deal with Perl Philosophy, its community and Basics of Perl Language. The contents are very informative and full summary on what you can achieve through Perl. You can start writing simple Perl code just after reading first three chapters too!&lt;br/ &gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Next three chapters on Operators, Functions and Regular Expression will make you almost a Perl programmer within no time. If you don&#8217;t want to use object oriented Perl, then You will find yourself a comfortable programmer in Perl&#8217;s zone. But Perl&#8217;s power can&#8217;t be judged by stopping there. So next few chapters will show you the real implementation and object Oriented Perl&lt;br/&gt;

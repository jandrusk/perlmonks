  <doctext>I picked up this book in the hope of finding one that would provide an in-depth discussion of the CGI module and its various uses. What I got instead was a book that touched briefly on the CGI module, and then continued on to discuss the eXtropia Application Development Tool, which can be found on the book's companion CD, and at the [http://www.extropia.com|eXtropia] website, which used to be known as Selena Sol's Script Archive&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
To be fair, the book does a very good job of covering the security aspects of CGI scripts (using -T and -w, use strict, and taint checking), as well as covering some basics of web server security as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Overall, I found this book to be a waste of time and money. Go get [KM]'s book, or the Rat book.&lt;BR&gt;</doctext>

  <doctext>A well thought out book that is very useful to have. I would rank it up there with Perl In a Nutshell.&lt;br&gt; Takes you through almost everything and it uses code&lt;br&gt; that is easy to follow and implement. Very understandable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Each sample is written in a clear format. First the script, then the output and then an explaination of the script. There &lt;br&gt;are 13 chapters that cover Variables, Operators, Regex, Conditionals,&lt;br&gt; FileHandles, Subs, Interfacing, and much more. Each code sample is quite easy to follow
You'll learn exactly what you need to know--and every new function is demonstrated.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The book evolved from a Perl Programming class at the University of California. &lt;br&gt;
Hard to find, but worth the search.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Here is a sample;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

$firstVar  = 20;
$secondVar = 20;

$firstVar++ if ($secondVar == 10);

print(&quot;firstVar  = $firstVar\n&quot;);
print(&quot;secondVar = $secondVar\n&quot;);

This program prints:

firstVar  = 20
secondVar = 20


The program doesn't increment $firstVar because the value of $secondVar is 20 at &lt;br&gt;the time the condition is evaluated. If you changed the 10 to a 20&lt;br&gt; in the condition, Perl would increment $firstVar.
&lt;/pre&gt;</doctext>

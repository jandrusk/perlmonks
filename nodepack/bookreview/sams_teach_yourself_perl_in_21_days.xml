  <doctext>&lt;p&gt;I knew absolutely nothing about PERL before getting this book, and it really gave me a good basic understanding of the language.  As much as everyone loves the o'reilly books, I found them to be too wordy for my learning style.  This book set me up with a daily plan on how to get into the language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Usually, the lessons took less than a day each, but it was difficult to get through 3 or more lessons in a day and still retain all of the information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you actually use this book daily, it is easy to gain a pretty good hold of the basics in about 2 weeks.  you'll understand basic looops, file I/O, regexes, arrays, etc.  There is a section that deals with CGI, but I didn't really look at it, so I can't comment on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But, that's just my opinion...&lt;/p&gt;

  <doctext>This is a O'Rielly book.  Wrtten very nicely, by Dr. James Tisdall.  It is really useful, if you are just begining to learn programming.  The examples given and the excercises at the end of each chapter are really very nice and they give you a 'hands on' training.  The book is pretty simple to read and neatly organized.  The only thing i would like to have from it is a solution to all the excercises that it has mentioned.  There are about 10 excercises per chapter for each of 13 chapters.  But detailed solutions are avialable only for first 8 chapters.  Though it is expected that a person is fairly competent to be able to slove the reamining question on his/her own, it will be really nice if those solutions were also put on net for free access.  Bye the way, the initial excercises and all the examples are avialabe from the website for download.  Infact all the subroutines dicussed are also present as a &quot;.pm&quot; on the sites. It really helps in using the book</doctext>

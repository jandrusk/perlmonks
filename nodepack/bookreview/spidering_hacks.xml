  <doctext>I am in the process of teaching myself Perl, and found this book to be a helpful reference to look to when something was not clear to me in Perl &amp; LWP (another good web automation book). It contains a large number of useful code snippets that apply to many common web automation situations. 
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
As a reference for the novice/intermediate Perl programmer - I would highly recommend it. As a complete tutorial in web automation, I would say that it is a bit lacking, and would recommend &quot;Perl &amp; LWP&quot; and &quot;HTTP: The Definitive Guide&quot;, both by O'Reilly, as a more comprehensive introduction to the subject.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

  <doctext>Hi,

I have been using this book to learn Perl and I find it really amazing. It starts from the basics and builds upon thereon...

Best thing about this is how the concepts are explained in easy to understand manner.

It gently nudges the reader into understanding the more complex concepts.

This is &quot;THE&quot; book for me and I am learning a lot from this.

If you are a beginner, go for this book.</doctext>

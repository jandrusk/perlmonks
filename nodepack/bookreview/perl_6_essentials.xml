  <doctext>Although I would tend to agree with my fellow monks in that Perl 6 is still quite a distance off and we can only speculate on it's true final form; this book's title immediately caught my attention when passing by the computer section of Perl at my local bookstore.
&lt;BR&gt;
Here is the book's layout:&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;UL&gt;
&lt;LI&gt;Chapter 1 - Project Overview: &quot;The Birth of Perl 6....&quot;
&lt;LI&gt;Chapter 2 - Project Development: &quot;Developement of the Language and Virtual Compiler...&quot;
&lt;LI&gt;Chapter 3 - Design Philosophy: &quot;Linguistic, Cognitive &amp;amp; Architectural Considerations...&quot;
&lt;LI&gt;Chapter 4 - Syntax: &quot;Variables, Operators, Control Structures, etc. ...&quot;
&lt;LI&gt;Chapter 5 - Parrot Internals: &quot;A look at the core of Parrot the virtual runtime machine....&quot;
&lt;LI&gt;Chapter 6 - Parrot Assembly Language: &quot;An Introduction to Parrot...'
&lt;LI&gt;Chapter 7 - Intermediate Code Compiler: &quot;An Intro. to Parrot's Intermediate Code Compiler&quot;
&lt;/UL&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
I found that this book, in my opinion, to be true to its form; very well structured and organized. It's key strength is the use of concrete examples.  The author(s) present a particular topic then show it is finitely utilized in relevant yet simple code example.  They were even able to explain the Parrot assembly language into terms that I was able to begin to understand. Impressive. &lt;BR&gt;
Again, I realize that Perl 6 is certainly only in its early formative stages, without a doubt subject to lots of change; however, I must say that I enjoyed this book.  It gave me finite insight into the possibilites of Perl6!.
I am indeed looking forward to the &lt;A HREF=&quot;http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/059600737X/index.html&quot;&gt;Second Edition&lt;/A&gt; of this book.&lt;BR&gt;
Enjoy the Read!</doctext>

&lt;h3&gt;Why is the &quot;number of write-ups&quot; wrong?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When you see a user's &quot;number of write-ups&quot;, this is a number which
PerlMonks maintains, incrementing it each time a user posts. 
Maintaining this number statically is more efficient than re-counting
the user's writeups each time someone wants to see it.
However, over time this number can &quot;drift&quot; away from the true count, due
to a few rare conditions (let's not call them bugs).
&lt;!--
Several bugs which caused inaccurate write-up numbers have been fixed, but
there are still some bugs (such as race conditions) which can cause this 
problem, though it is rather rare.  
--&gt;
This is why &quot;&lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; appears before the write-up number on [id://6364] 
(it stands for &quot;approximately&quot;).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For another reason why a user's displayed &quot;number of write-ups&quot;
may not match their true count, see [id://162297].
Or, if you are a member of [pmdev] looking at a fellow [pmdev]il's writeups,
then you may also see non-public nodes (such as patches) listed which are not
accounted for in their &quot;number&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If your own write-up number is wrong&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you suspect that the number of your write-ups displayed is inaccurate, 
you can reset it by doing the following:&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to [User Settings]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Press the &quot;submit&quot; button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
You do not need to change any of the settings.&lt;br&gt;
If your write-up number was inaccurate, 
the resulting page
will have a note at the top 
explaining that your number was updated.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
There is no way to correct another user's write-up number. You could try
[/msg]ing them and pointing them to the procedure above.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to the [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;

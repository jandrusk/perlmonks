&lt;h1&gt;Level 26: Saint&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Saints are just saints.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There's nothing special about them (beyond the halo).  We used to put them on dish cleaning duty in the Monastery Kitchen but the [NodeReaper] kept scaring them when he made his pies and we had to stop.  Actually nobody has cleaned any dishes since then either. Any volunteers? 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--
&lt;p&gt;
Saints have the following powers:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; the power to see invisible ink (but only when their eyes are closed)!-- tye --
&lt;li&gt; the power to just *know* (that there is &lt;i&gt;no&lt;/i&gt; spoon) !-- dws --
&lt;li&gt; passphrase to enter Saintly Snooker Hall !-- ybiC --
&lt;li&gt; keys to the Saintly Liquor Cabinet !-- ybiC --
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Level 26 monks also get more votes than Level 25 monks.
See the [id://5938] for details.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you're curious about [Saints in our Book], that happens at [id://504005].

  <doctext>&lt;h1&gt;How do I create a Poll?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;!--
Constructed from information originally presented in the thread at
[id://260397].  Most of the good stuff is due to [tye] (of course).
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You cannot create a poll directly.  Only a [pollsters|pollster] has that ability.
Instead, you must &lt;b&gt;suggest&lt;/b&gt; a poll idea to the [pollsters].  If they
like it, they will set up the poll.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Here are the steps:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Read all of the [id://1609] and all of the poll ideas quests &amp;mdash; 
[id://68307|original], [id://626523|2nd], [id://734686|3rd], [id://815171|4th], [id://880023|5th] &amp;amp; [id://945799|current]
&amp;mdash; to ensure that you're not duplicating a past poll or poll idea, and to see what ideas have worked in the past and which haven't.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Draft the complete wording of your poll. No one will do it for you.  Polls have the following pieces:
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Question/topic - this becomes the node title and so cannot include links or html&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prologue paragraph (optional)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One or more choices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Post a new note in the [id://945799] thread, containing your suggested
poll.
&lt;li&gt; Send a message to the [pollsters] (&lt;tt&gt;[msg://pollsters]&lt;/tt&gt;) pointing them
at your new note in the [id://945799] thread.
&lt;li&gt; Go on about your life as if nothing has happened.
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
People can upvote and downvote polls. This will provide feedback that should
make the polls more likely to be of the type most appreciated by the
voting monk population.  And if you submit a very good poll suggestion,
then the [pollsters] may &lt;!-- (with your permission) --&gt; make the poll owned by you,
so that you get any XP reward.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;!-- from [VSarkiss]: (humor surgically removed) --&gt;
It must be stressed that the polling booth
is for amusement only, and should not be taken seriously.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you are a [pollsters|pollster], please see [id://505949].
&lt;/p&gt;

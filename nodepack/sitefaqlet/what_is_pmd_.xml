[href://?node_id=1040#post|bottom] of that page (but please review
[id://483077] first).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major changes to the site will be announced in the [id://1040|PMD] section
though it will also contain other threads such as questions about the site.
Minor (and major) changes to the site are recorded in [Tidings].&lt;/p&gt;

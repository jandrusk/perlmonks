  <doctext>&lt;h1&gt;May I post a job ad?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;No.&lt;/b&gt; PerlMonks is not to be used as a job board.
&lt;!-- stereotype: [628399] --&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Job postings (either offering or looking for) should be posted to &lt;b&gt;[http://jobs.perl.org/|jobs.perl.org]&lt;/b&gt;,
which exists specifically for this purpose.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
And if your &quot;job&quot; posting isn't appropriate for jobs.perl.org, then it is even less appropriate at PerlMonks.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, monks should feel free to use their home nodes for this kind of advertisement.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are several good reasons for not supporting the posting of job ads here, including:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Postings on PerlMonks have a permanent character, whereas job ads are ephemeral.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; PerlMonks already has a well defined focus; this should not be altered.
(If the Perl community did not already have [http://jobs.perl.org/|an outstanding resource] for job ads, 
then it might be appropriate to consider doing it at PerlMonks.
As it is, it's not something we need worry about.)
&lt;li&gt; If we did change the scope of PerlMonks to include job ads, 
we'd probably have to have even stricter rules than jobs.perl.org on what kinds of posts are acceptable;
so there really would be nothing to be gained.
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Whereas some PerlMonks levels give users special powers (such as at level 5, monks have the can add a picture to their home node), other levels (Scribe, Pilgrim, Hermit, Chaplain, Deacon, and so on) just get an increase in the number of votes they are able to allocated each day. For more information on this, see [id://509805].

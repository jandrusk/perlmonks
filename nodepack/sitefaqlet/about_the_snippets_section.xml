[Snippets Section|Snippets] was an old section intended for the posting of very small bits of code &amp;mdash; e.g., one-liners.
It was redundant with [Cool Uses For Perl], and so was put out to pasture (i.e. disabled).
All new code postings (other than obfu and poetry) should be done in [CUFP].
&lt;/p&gt;

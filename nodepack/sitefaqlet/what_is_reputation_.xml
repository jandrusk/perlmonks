&lt;h1&gt;What is reputation?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each node has a numeric &lt;i&gt;reputation&lt;/i&gt;, which is a (very unreliable)
indicator of the PerlMonks community's collective estimation of the node.
A node's reputation is simply the sum of the ++ and -- votes that node has received.
So, for example, if 5 monks voted ++ on a node and 3 other monks voted -- on it,
then that node's reputation would be 2.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Please remember that &lt;i&gt;only nodes&lt;/i&gt; have a quantitative reputation; Monks do not.
Every registered monk has &lt;i&gt;experience points&lt;/i&gt;, which are calculated, in part, from
the reputations of his/her nodes. See [id://5938] for the gory details.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(Of course, everyone has &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; reputation and &lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; experience, but
PerlMonks makes no attempt to quantify these. :-)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to the [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Level 2: Novice&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the lowest level at which you get a daily quota of votes to spend on other monks' nodes.  
With each new level you attain, this quota increases. Details at [id://5938].
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
(If you happen to lose enough XP to take you back down to [id://21211], and you still have some unspent votes, don't worry &amp;mdash; unused votes never get taken away.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Note also that at this level (actually, all levels 1 through 5), you get an &lt;b&gt;XP bonus&lt;/b&gt; for spending your entire daily vote quota.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Level 2 is also the minimum level at which you get to see the [Worst Nodes] listings.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
See also: [id://17381]

[Craft] was an old section intended for the posting of substantial chunks of code (scripts, modules, etc.)
It was superceded by [Code Catacombs] and [Cool Uses For Perl], and subsequently put out to pasture (i.e. disabled).
All new code postings (other than obfu and poetry) should be done in [CUFP].
&lt;/p&gt;

2005-10-30 [ysth] releveling (title only)
--&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Level 9: Friar&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
(This level was numbered 6 in an [id://504121|older] level numbering system.)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is the minimum level at which you may 
[id://17688|moderate] and [id://92975|consider].
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
It is also the level at which one becomes eligible for membership in 
[id://238736|groups] of the [Cabal], such as [SiteDocClan] and [pmdev].
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As soon as you reach this level, you'll want to enable your 
&lt;b&gt;[id://590076|Approval Nodelet]&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;br/&gt;
(Go to your [id://25185] and enter a non-zero order number for this nodelet.)
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You will now always see unmoderated content, regardless of your 
[href://?node_id=786919#misc|Miscellaneous Settings].
&lt;!-- this seems not to be true. not sure how this rumor got started. did it used to be true?
&lt;br/&gt;(In fact, if you have &lt;i&gt;Show Unmoderated Content&lt;/i&gt; turned on,
you'll probably want to turn it off, or you will see unmoderated content in duplicate!)
--&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See also:&lt;/b&gt; [id://5938]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to the [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;

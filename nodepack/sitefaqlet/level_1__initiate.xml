&lt;h1&gt;Level 1: Initiate&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When you [id://101|register] on [id://131|PerlMonks], you begin as an initiate.
This is the first of [id://509805|many levels] you can achieve as a
community member. Just for registering, you get several perks right away.
Here are some of the things any registered monk can do:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;
You get your own personal [id://17639|&quot;home node&quot;], where you can post information about yourself. Any time your name is displayed by the site (for example, in the chatterbox), it is linked to your home node.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
You can customize PerlMonks to suit your preferences via your [id://786919|user settings].
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
You can post nodes in your own name instead of as [id://500334|Anonymous Monk].
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
You can gain (and lose!) [id://5938|experience points (XP)] by people voting on your nodes, and via other means. (And since you're new and we're kind to new Monks, you have a chance of earning XP each day just for logging in.)  But since you took the trouble to register, we'll guess you have a question.  So go ahead and ask it ... after reading [id://174051] and [id://674668]. (We are NOT always gentle with those who fail to read and heed the Monastery's standards.) 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
You can move up (and down!) [id://509805|levels (with their attendant perqs)] by gaining/losing XP.
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
You can use the [id://236794|Chatterbox] to chat with other users and ask basic questions. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There are many more things you can't do if you're not registered and logged in.
A fairly comprehensive summary of these can be found in [Restrictions of the Anonymous Monk].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;See also:&lt;/b&gt; the [id://5938]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to the [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;

  <doctext>&lt;!-- 2004-01-27 - jdporter - Referred to main [Chatterbox FAQ] --&gt;
&lt;!-- 2003-08-22 - jdporter - converted links to use [].
     Changed to suggest asking in the chatterbox BEFORE posting a SoPW. --&gt;
&lt;!-- 2003-05-23 - Mr. Muskrat - link to FAQ by id --&gt;

&lt;H2&gt;What is the Chatterbox?&lt;/H2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
The chatterbox is the only existing chat area here at PerlMonks. 
It serves as both a [id://17434|public chatroom] and a place where you can 
send and receive [id://17534|private messages] to/from other members.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Almost anything you might think to ask about the Chatterbox is
addressed in the main [id://236794|Chatterbox FAQ].
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
If you have a question for the Perl Monks, you should probably ask 
it in the chatterbox before posting in [id://479].
Many times, what you think is a difficult/complicated problem is easily
solved by someone in the chatterbox.  Or they may tell you you should
post in [Seekers of Perl Wisdom].  Either way, it's a good, quick way
to take advantage of other monks' experience.
If you strike out in the chatterbox, you can always post in 
[Seekers of Perl Wisdom].
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

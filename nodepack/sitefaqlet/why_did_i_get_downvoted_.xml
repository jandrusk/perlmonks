&lt;h1&gt;Why did I get downvoted?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Yes, people do occasionally -- (downvote) a node.  Their reasons are as [id://20974|varied] as their haircuts, and make about as much sense.  The best thing to do is to not get hung up on your nodes' [id://18538|reputation].  Be more concerned about your &lt;i&gt;personal&lt;/i&gt; reputation!
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Changes in your nodes' reputation can affect your [id://5938|XP]... but again, this barometer of personal worth should not be given too much weight; it's really just a game we play to make life at the Monastery more interesting.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
As the nice people at 
[http://www.everything2.com/|Everything]
[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=Voting%2FExperience%20System|have noted]:

    &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;[gods|The administration] does &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; take the voting and experience point system all that seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;u&gt;Woe unto those who do.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;XP is an imaginary number granted to you by an anonymous stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historically, posts complaining about or suggesting radical changes to the [id://5938] are themselves unpopular; most get downvoted and many get [id://409197|reaped].
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[tye] has written a nice FAQ-like node which could be (but isn't) entitled
[id://590525|Why does it seem like I have an enemy who is systematically downvoting every node I post?] 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Is PerlMonks a good place to get answers for homework?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Many questions posed to the monastery get shot down with a summary &quot;Do your own homework!&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But, in general, monks will refuse to produce the goods in response to a homework-type question.
Some reasons are:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; They think that you would learn more by doing it yourself. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; They are insulted because you think that your time is more valuable than theirs. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; They think that you are showing disrespect for the effort which they have put into learning what they know by asking for the answers to be handed to you. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; They do not want to be a part of someone else's (possible or perceived) dishonorable conduct. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
On the other hand, most monks will not mind &lt;i&gt;helping&lt;/i&gt; you with your homework, provided that you:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Indicate up front that it is a homework assignment; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Show everything you've tried so far; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Ask specific questions for help getting over specific hurdles. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Rather than post a request for help with homework, try some of the following ways to work it out yourself.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Get some Perl books. [http://perl.oreilly.com/|O'Reilly] books are highly rated, for example. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Go to [http://perldoc.perl.org/] to read the Perl documentation on line. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Use [doc://perldoc] to read the Perl documentation on your own system. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Use [Super Search] to find how other people have solved similar problems. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Look in [Tutorials] for articles which cover your problem area. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to the [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;

2004-09-23 [jdporter] Removed Craft and the FAQ thing at the end. Added PMD, Snippets, Q&amp;A, News, Reviews, NN, Offering Plate. Rearranged to the same order as in the &quot;menu bar&quot;.  However, even though the order is the now the same as on the menu bar, the titles are drawn directly from the nodes.  The most egregious case is &quot;Q&amp;A&quot;.  Can we rely on the novice to connect the name of the section listed here with the link in the menu bar?
2005-03-14 [ysth] added recently active threads; reordered the comment listing the sections to how the menu bar is now
2006-06-13 [jdporter] re-workd to follow the organization used in the three nodelets, with some minor adjustments.

&lt;h1&gt;The Perl Monks Guide to the Monastery&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Welcome to PerlMonks, the Monastery of Perl.
We hope your stay is long and enjoyable.
You are probably wondering what this is all about.
Hopefully this page will answer some of those questions.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- &lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;What is this all about, exactly?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt; --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
PerlMonks is many things to many people, including:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A medium for making Perl as non-intimidating to learn and as easy to use as possible&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place for Perl programmers (such as you) to improve your skills and share your expertise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A community which allows everyone to grow and learn from everyone else&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;!-- According to the &quot;menu bar&quot;:

&lt;h3&gt;Finding Your Way Around&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
First, the Monastery has some repositories of information useful to the
Perl Monk, designed to help you get the most out of your experience here.
Second, we have a number of areas, called &lt;i&gt;sections&lt;/i&gt;, where people can
post code, questions, and responses (known generically as &quot;nodes&quot;) in a
threaded forum-like format.
As an adjunct to those sections, there are various views into the great
node repository which assist you in finding nodes of interest to you
&amp;mdash; recently posted nodes, say, or meditations posted by a certain monk.
Finally, we have an assortment of pages not easily classifiable elsewhere.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#info&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Information&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#sections&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Sections&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#find&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Find Interesting Nodes&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;#misc&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;Additional Miscellany&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;b&gt;[id://1747] (deprecated)&lt;/b&gt; -
    This was intended as a place to post full-blown programs and modules.

    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;b&gt;[id://481|Craft] (deprecated)&lt;/b&gt; -
    This was a place for perlsmiths to showcase their code. 
    As such, it was redundant with [Cool Uses For Perl],

&lt;h3&gt;Why does the XP nodelet say that I have some number of &lt;u&gt;dog&lt;/u&gt; votes left?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If the majority of the last several votes cast by you were down-votes (and if you still have votes left to cast today), then your XP Nodelet will contain a link to this FAQlet.  This gives you a visual cue that casting more down-votes will incur an increasing chance (up to a maximum of 1/3) of costing you 1 XP per down-vote you cast.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If you find the prospect of losing a few XP distasteful, then you will need to find at least a few more-deserving nodes that you can up-vote to get your &quot;voting average&quot; back above zero for a while.  Also, you may want to consider being less quick to down-vote nodes (considering how distasteful you find losing XP to be and since your down-votes cause others to lose XP).  Down-voting nodes for relatively minor reasons can often be disruptive to our community.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to the [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;

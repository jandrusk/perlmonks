The [gods] are the system administrators of the PerlMonks web site. 
In principle, there's not much they can't do.
For example:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they have full access to the site's code, database, and logs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they perform site maintenance and development tasks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;they can run statistics on database records, e.g. to look at usage patterns.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Because the [gods] wield ultimate power in PerlMonks, they effectively determine the policies which reign here. And indeed, the [gods] are the ultimate arbiters of site policy. So you know whom to complain to if you don't like the way things are. :-)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Even so, the [gods] operate according to an ethic which reflects the site's tradition of voluntary self-restraint and mutual respect.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;What is PerlMonks?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
According to [vroom], its initiator,

&lt;!--
[vroom] has been
[http://web.archive.org/web/20011224183800/http://www.pair.com/pair/current/insider/1201/damianconway.html|quoted]
as saying that
--&gt;

PerlMonks is:

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    An attempt to make learning Perl as non-intimidating and easy to use as possible.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    A place for individuals to polish, improve, and showcase their Perl skills.
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    A community which allows everyone to grow and learn from each other.
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[nate] had the following to 
[http://webdevelopment.developersnetwork.com/Articles.asp?Article=100|say]
about the genesis of PerlMonks:
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
  We were aiming for a cool Internet hangout for Perl gurus
  and semi-advanced users.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  We wanted to offer an environment where people could ask questions,
  post their best work, and just basically geek out on Perl.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  My first official title in the company was &quot;Perl Monk&quot;.
  I guess I liked the philosophy behind being a monk.
  There's a religious connotation, and Perl is a language
  that some people take as seriously as a religion.
  Monasteries are culturally known as centers of learning and
  knowledge, and that is a good analogy of what we're trying to build.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
  All these questions people are asking will make a
  tremendous archive of Q&amp;A-style documentation.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Perl&lt;/b&gt; refers to [http://www.perl.org/about.html|the programming language],
while &lt;b&gt;&lt;tt&gt;perl&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/b&gt; refers
to an implementation of that language, or any of the associated technologies
and projects, such as [http://www.parrotcode.org/|Parrot] and
[http://www.pugscode.org/|Pugs]. 
See [doc://perlfaq1#What's-the-difference-between-&quot;perl&quot;-and-&quot;Perl&quot;?]
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;monks&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; We use &quot;PerlMonks&quot; to refer to this web site and the
community centered on it. It is a singular noun.&lt;br/&gt; &quot;Perl Monks&quot;, a
plural noun, refers to the people who participate in this community.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You will occasionally see &quot;PerlMonks&quot; abbreviated as &quot;PM&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
&quot;[id://273733|Why does PerlMonks work?]&quot; is a discussion thread in which several denizens of
the PerlMonks community express their feelings about how and why the
community works so effectively.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PerlMonks is built on the &quot;Everything Engine&quot; (version 1).
For a history of Everything, see [http://everything2.com/title/The+E2+Backstory|The E2 Backstory] @everything2.

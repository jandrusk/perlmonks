  <doctext>This was one of the first scripts I wrote. I needed to rapidly find strings in compressed IIS logfiles, and this was the result.

It handles both compressed and uncompressed logfiles in the same directory, but does not handle ZIP files with more than one file inside.

Any feedback welcomed.

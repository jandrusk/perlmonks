## recursively comparing arbitrary heterogenous data structures
## an experiment in functional programming idioms implemented in perl
##
## by anders pearson &lt;anders@columbia.edu&gt;
## 2001-07-06
##
## functions to traverse two arbitrary complex data structures
## (lists of lists, lists of hashes, lists of hashes of lists and scalars,
## etc, etc) comparing them by value. 
## 
## known issues: 
##   - does not deal with GLOB,CODE,LVALUE or other more exotic types
##   - makes no provision for avoiding circular references.
##     ie, it WILL get stuck on them
##
## enjoy and let me know if you see any problems or can think of
## better ways to do anything.

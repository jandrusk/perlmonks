  <doctext>#   Howdy! This is my very first Perl script! I know it's kinda short
#   but any response would be great. What I am trying to do next is to make 
#   it in a CGI/HTML format to put on a web page. Hints anyone?



#!/usr/local/bin/perl -w

print &quot;Guess the number.&quot;;
print &quot;DIRECTIONS:\nGuess a number between 1 and 100 inclusive.\n\n&quot;;
$random = int(rand(100)+1);      # I added 1 to the random
                                 # number generator to push the
                                 # possible numbers from 0-99 to 1-100

for ($try=6;$try&gt;0;$try--){      # $try is the number of tries you get (DUH!)
    print &quot;You have 1 try left. Use it wisely!\n\n&quot; if($try ==1);
    print &quot;You have $try tries left.\n\n&quot; if($try !=1);
    print &quot;What is your guess? --&gt;&quot;;
    do {
        $guess = &lt;STDIN&gt;; chomp $guess;

     }while (!$guess);
    print &quot;HA! HA! too HIGH.\n&quot; if ($guess&gt;$random);
    print &quot;OH! NO! too LOW.\n&quot; if ($guess&lt;$random);
    if ($guess==$random){
        print &quot;'Bout time you guessed it.   Stupid head.\n\n&quot; ;
        exit;
    }
}
print &quot;The answer was $random. And so is your IQ.\n\n\nSTUPID!!\n\n&quot;;
exit;

#  NOTE: the problem with this is that it loops            #
#  printing the button text box ect. w/o giving you a      #
#  chance to guess. Still a work in progress.              #

=head1 savetime / loadtime

  This pair of simple scripts that are useful for making sure that
  file times remain correct even after small updates.

  I use it to make sure that the photos from my digital camera have
  the original times, even after some retouching or evil FTP clients
  which do not set the right times...

  To install: Copy the file to somewhere within the path and make a
  (symbolic) link to it, so that it appears in two names: loadtime and
  savetime.

=head2 savetime

  Creates the file '.filetimes' in the current directory and stores
  access and modification time for all of the files in the current
  directory.

=head2 loadtime

  Resets the file times for all the files that have different time
  than what is written in '.filetimes'.

  It will print one line for each file that is updated, containing the
  number of seconds that have been changed.

=cut 

if($0=~/savetime/)
  { my @f=&lt;*&gt;;

  open(F, &quot;&gt;.filetimes&quot;) or die &quot;open .filetimes: $!\n&quot;;
  for (@f) {
    my ($atime, $mtime)=(stat($_))[8,9];
    print F &quot;$_ $atime $mtime\n&quot;;
  }
}

if($0=~/loadtime/) {
  die unless -f &quot;.filetimes&quot;;

  open(F, &quot;&lt;.filetimes&quot;) or die &quot;open .filetimes: $!\n&quot;;
  while(&lt;F&gt;) {
    my ($n,$a,$m) = split;
    $atime{$n} = $a;
    $mtime{$n} = $m;
  }
  close(F);

  for (&lt;*&gt;) {
    my ($a, $m)=(stat($_))[8,9];
    next if($a==$atime{$_} and $m==$mtime{$_});
    print &quot;$_ \t&quot;, $a-$atime{$_}, &quot; \t&quot;,$m-$mtime{$_}, &quot;\n&quot;;
    utime $atime{$_}, $mtime{$_}, $_ or die &quot;utime: $!\n&quot;;
  }
}

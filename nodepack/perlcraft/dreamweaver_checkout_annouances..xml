  <doctext>Yes, I realize that this is only half perl, and could easily be done in just perl.
But I think it's neat. It reads a director for dreamweaver(I have no idea what other 
software uses for lockfiles) Lockfiles, and tells you who has which script or file checked 
out. Uses some silly ansi highlighting.

takes args from ls with xargs


#!/bin/bash

ls *.LCK|xargs perl -e'for(@ARGV){open(FD,&quot;&lt;$_&quot;);$f=join(&quot;&quot;,&lt;FD&gt;);$f=~s/\n//;$_ =~ s/(.*)\.LCK/\e[44m$1\e[0m$2/;print&quot;$_ [$f]\n&quot; }'

  <doctext>*Recently I was charged with creating a two node Veritas Cluster
*server. Everything in VCS resolves around this config file.
*Since all of the binaries in VCS are written in Perl and with
*the increasing popularity of this product I thought some monks
*might find this useful. This configuration fails over four
*resources, Apache, Sendmail, SMMS and the RAID. When any
*of the apps fail Veritas umounts /var/md and mounts it on
*the other system and then starts up the apps. you must write
*a small monitoring script for each app and place it in
*/opt/VRTSvcs/bin. The monitoring script simply needs to
*return &quot;online&quot; or &quot;offline&quot; (pgrep works well)
*Anyways I hope someone finds this useful
*the config file is pretty easy to read. Cheers!!!

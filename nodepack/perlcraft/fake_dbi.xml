So I'm cranking away on a database script, when I realize &quot;OOPS,
I'm trying to make a query to a database that I can't connect to
yet&quot; (dang difficulties with DBD::ODBC).  Well, what I'm doing is
correct and all, but I obviously can't test it.  The only way to
connect to the DB currently is to use a seperate ODBC program.  I
didn't want to go rip out my DBI code and put in stuff to display
the queries since it was just temporary.

So polymorphism to the rescue.  :)  And the FakeDB package was
born.  It does one thing, it recognizes prepares, executes and
finishes (trivially).  So you can prepare your query, and then
instead of executing it, dump those queries out to a file to be
imported elsewhere.

You can use it with just:

use FakeDB; 
$dbh = &quot;FakeDB&quot;;	#or whatever your database handle is

and everything else works the same as before, it just now dumps
your queries to a file upon executions.

Useful to you?  Dunno, but it sure was to me.  :)


=end

package FakeDB;

open QUERIES, &quot;&gt;./query.txt&quot;;

sub prepare {
	my ($class, $query) = @_;
	return bless \$query, $class;
};

sub execute {
	my $self = shift;
	my @values = @_;
	
	my $tpl = $$self;
	
	foreach (@values){
		$tpl =~ s/\?/$_/;
	};
	
	$tpl =~ s/\n//g;
	$tpl =~ s/\s+/ /g;
	print QUERIES &quot;$tpl\n&quot;;
	return 1;
};

sub finish {return 1};

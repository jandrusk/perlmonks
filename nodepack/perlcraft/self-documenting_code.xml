# I use the following little 6-line snippet in almost every script 
# I write for public consumption. It allows me to use embedded 
# POD documentation for the script as its usage statement, 
# saving me the trouble of maintaining separate documentation 
# and usage statements and allowing me to easily create HTML, 
# LaTeX, PDF, or whatever kind of documentation for the script 
# that I like.

# It's so trivial, it almost seems silly to post it; however, 
# I've found it to be quite useful.

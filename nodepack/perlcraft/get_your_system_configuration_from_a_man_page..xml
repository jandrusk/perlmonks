  <doctext>Okay, this is a bit old, but I found it, and it was fun to do ;)) &lt;BR&gt;
SUN needed the configuration of our system, I could do it in C&lt;BR&gt;
but didn't feel like cutting and pasting everything:&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;CODE&gt;
#!/usr/bin/perl -w
use strict;

my (@Variables,@Code);

foreach (`man sysconf`)
{
 s/^\s+//;
 my $Var=(split /\s+/,$_,2)[0] or next;
 next unless ($Var=~/^_[A-Z_]+$/o);
 my $Cvar=lc $Var;
 push @Variables,&quot;long int $Cvar=sysconf($Var);&quot;;
 push @Code,&quot;printf(\&quot;$Var set to: \%d\\n\&quot;,$Cvar);&quot;;
};
local $&quot;=&quot;\n &quot;;

print &lt;&lt; &quot;PROGRAM&quot;;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;unistd.h&gt;

int main (argc,argv)
int argc;
char *argv[];
{
 @Variables
 @Code
}
PROGRAM
&lt;/CODE&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Presto!!! redirect to getconf.c, compile, run, be happy....&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
I have to add here that this code is NOT &lt;BR&gt;
very portable... In this case it didn't need to be... &lt;BR&gt;
It was short and worked ([jeroenes] posted an update here, and&lt;BR&gt;
I did some updating myself, so this should have made it a bit&lt;BR&gt;
more portable (for what I don't know though ;))&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
You MAY run into gcc compiling errors, this is a result from labels in&lt;BR&gt;
the man page not being in your include file&lt;BR&gt;
delete those items ;))&lt;BR&gt;

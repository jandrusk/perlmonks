# E-mail Redirect (for protecting addresses from E-mail-Address-Collecting Bots)
# by David Glick [davisagli], 6/25/2001

# when given an e-mail address in the form &quot;[user],[domain]&quot;,
# this script returns an HTTP redirect to &quot;mailto:[user]@[domain]&quot;

# This can be used to prevent spam-bots from finding e-mail
# addresses in HTML links; for example, instead of linking to
# &quot;mailto:me@mydomain&quot;, you can link to &quot;this_script.pl?me,mydomain&quot;

# Comments/improvements welcome; I don't have much experience with CGI.

# Update 6/25/2001: The security risk that [bikeNomad] pointed out
# shouldn't be an issue now.  Also implemented his other suggestions.
# Thanks much, bikeNomad!

  <doctext># A program to download a lot of images from a site
# quickly using LWP::Simple.  Assuming you have appropriate
# permission, etc to download the images, and that the
# images have sequential names (like img_001.jpg, 
# img_002.jpg...), this program will load those images 
# into the current folder.  You have to have the 
# LWP::Simple module for this to work. -tim allen

use LWP::Simple;
use strict;
 
# first part of the URL of the image
# replace the URL and path info here appropriately
my($pix)='http://tim/images/img_';  
 
for (my $i=1;$i&lt;100;$i++) {
  # this bit assumes the numbers of the files are zero
  # padded to three zeroes (thanks btrott for sprintf
  # pointer)
  my $f = sprintf '%03d',$i;
  # create the full URL of the image
  # (like http://www.somesite.com/images/img_001.jpg)
  my $url = $pix . $f . &quot;.jpg&quot;;
  # If we get the header, the image file exists

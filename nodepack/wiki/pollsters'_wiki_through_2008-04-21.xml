Welcome, [Arunbear].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Proposal:
&lt;c&gt;
My preference on serifs:
Serif
Sans-Serif
&lt;/c&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

New poll proposal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
When I see &quot;No recent polls found&quot; in the [id://590108|Voting Booth Nodelet], I:

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Submit a new poll suggestion to [id://626523]
&lt;li&gt;Petition the [gods] to join [id://275323] and do my share
&lt;li&gt;Complain vociferously but do nothing else
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], &lt;a href=&quot;#2008-02-22 00:28:59&quot; name=&quot;2008-02-22 00:28:59&quot;&gt;[localtime://2008-02-22 00:28:59]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[bobf] has declared his well-worked poll finished, so let's post it when the
current poll is about 2 weeks old:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

I posted it about a day ago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], &lt;a href=&quot;#2008-01-30 21:47:14&quot; name=&quot;2008-01-30 21:47:14&quot;&gt;[localtime://2008-01-30 21:47:14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Proposed poll for posting around Feb 8th..11th:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;c&gt;
I pledged my undying love to PerlMonks and all I got was...
This stupid St. Valentine's week poll
An embarrassing rash
An appointment at the free clinic
A presciption for antibiotics
A counceling session
Grounded
Suspended
More addicted
All of the above
&lt;/c&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-11-30 19:04:07&quot; name=&quot;2007-11-30 19:04:07&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-11-30 19:04:07]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Posted.  No cleaver options inserted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-11-23 00:38:12&quot; name=&quot;2007-11-23 00:38:12&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-11-23 00:38:12]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Oops.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[ww] suggested &lt;c&gt;$floor = floor();&lt;/c&gt; via /msg, as well. &lt;c&gt;floor()&lt;/c&gt; had occurred to me, but I'm somewhat tired of &quot;clever&quot; poll options.  I have no objection to either that or a bodies option, though.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I am very familiar with Pergo, but I knew &quot;Laminate&quot; covered it.  Good stuff.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-11-17 23:24:02&quot; name=&quot;2007-11-17 23:24:02&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-11-17 23:24:02]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;The bodies of my rivals&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
or perhaps the bodies of [gods] who don't close their PRE tags. :)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I'm only halfway proposing that first item be included in the poll.  I was going to ask that &quot;Composite&quot; be added, since that appeared to be what Pergo is (one of my favorite floor coverings), but it looks like &quot;Laminate&quot; applies so nevermind.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-11-17 16:33:46&quot; name=&quot;2007-11-17 16:33:46&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-11-17 16:33:46]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
Best Material for Floors:

Carpet
Ceramic
Marble
Granite
Slate
Hardwood
Bamboo
Vinyl
Linoleum
Laminate
Dirt
Other
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-11-11 23:51:13&quot; name=&quot;2007-11-11 23:51:13&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-11-11 23:51:13]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Went ahead and posted it based on lack of &quot;real&quot; complaining.  Bring on the bickering...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-11-11 22:36:05&quot; name=&quot;2007-11-11 22:36:05&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-11-11 22:36:05]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Likely that was it.  I figured it was something I did.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-11-11 14:46:39&quot; name=&quot;2007-11-11 14:46:39&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-11-11 14:46:39]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Well, it happily replaced them for me.  I changed the name from ysth to Petruchio in the two places but
the time still lies.  I note there's no edit history for your two comments.  I'm guessing you used the edit displaytype instead of the wiki-specific editpage.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-11-11 14:41:29&quot; name=&quot;2007-11-11 14:41:29&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-11-11 14:41:29]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is [Petruchio].  Oddly, the wikihead tag isn't being replaced in my comment below.  I'm wondering if I broke something.  :-)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-11-11 14:41:29&quot; name=&quot;2007-11-11 14:41:29&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-11-11 14:41:29]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I'm not really complaining, since there hasn't been a poll in
awhile... just be aware that this is likely to lead to a lot of
political bickering.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-11-10 23:50:45&quot; name=&quot;2007-11-10 23:50:45&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-11-10 23:50:45]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
New poll proposal [649901]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;c&gt;
A sure sign of the apocalypse:

Oil at $100/barrel
Ice caps melting, polar bears getting hungry
USA finally having a woman and a minority as serious contenders for the presidency
iTunes selling DRM-free music
Microsoft getting into &quot;open source&quot;
Perl6 completed
Voting Booth: No recent polls found
&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New poll proposal from [640195] w/ minor changes to be put up ASAPractical:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You've just spilled something on your tie at lunch... Do you:&lt;br /&gt;
Leave the tie on&lt;br /&gt;
Take the tie off&lt;br /&gt;
Ignore it since your tie is so ugly &lt;ins&gt;n&lt;/ins&gt;o one will notice&lt;br /&gt;
Ignore it since it makes your tie look better&lt;br /&gt;
Accessorize the stain by covering it with a band-aid&lt;br /&gt;
Put on the spare tie &lt;ins&gt;from&lt;/ins&gt; the bottom drawer&lt;br /&gt;
Go buy a spare tie for the bottom drawer&lt;br /&gt;
Improvise a new tie out of office supplies&lt;br /&gt;
Ties? We don't need no steenking ties!&lt;br /&gt;
I'm personally bringing back the Nehru collar look (since Keanu killed it)&lt;br /&gt;
Be thankful that it was only a hard copy of your source code&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

I'm probably not going to have time to put up any polls for the next month or so.
If anyone else feels so inspired, that'd be great.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

New poll proposal (can we say &quot;bastard&quot;?)
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;c&gt;
When I'm arguing with a fool...
chances are he's doing the same
certainly he's doing the same
I'm in clpmisc, being told I am an elitist bastard for pointing out that &quot;it doesn't work&quot; is not an appropriate description of the problem
he's claiming Perl to be &quot;constantly loosing ground on php&quot;
UR HLP CAN HAS BEEN SQL IS TOO MUCH DOCS PLZ SUPER URGENT THX.

The last one was too long and was phrased from a different perspective.  How about &quot;mention a previous weird computer problem of theirs, then look at me expectantly&quot;?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

New poll proposal:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;c&gt;
When I discuss scripting with family/friends, they...

turn and talk to somebody else
get nervous and hide the laptop
become intrigued
fall asleep
ask how to get a job
ask if I can automate their job
run away screaming
change the subject
call me a geek 
ask me whether I can also &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://xoa.petdance.com/Stop_saying_%22script%22&quot;&gt;program&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;
bring up some obscure problem they had with their computer that makes no sense, then look at you expectantly

Since y'all seem to have had a burst of creativity, I'd like us to be cycling the polls weekly (comment if you think another frequency works better).
&lt;p&gt;
Any comments on poll order now?  We've got &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-24 11:21:44&quot;&gt;How I like my steak:&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-23 12:08:46&quot;&gt;My favorite crew member from the original Star Trek:&lt;/a&gt;, and, from the
quest, [blazar]'s [id://627971|Were it not a monastery, my favourite metaphor for PerlMonks would have been:] and [id://627087|The best Dr.:] (the latter needing some research for more fictional doctors - I think restricted to TV would be good - and probably best run while memory of the Doctor Who poll is fresh but separated from the Star Trek poll).

Re: [tye]'s &quot;When it comes to dancing&quot;, can it be &quot;Sorry, can't&quot; instead of &quot;Sorry can't&quot;?

New poll proposal:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Adapted from [id://69024]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;c&gt;
My computer's last downtime was due to...
accidentally kicking out the plug
new kernel
%&amp;#@&amp;! blackout
weather related outage
new hardware/hardware malfunction
blue screen of death
dead battery
bedtime
&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Author: [id://8727]&lt;br /&gt;
Proposed uptime: around the end of this week
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Unless we want to cut the current poll kinda short and do
a US-centric holiday poll?  Maybe &quot;Fireworks make me think of...&quot;,
but I can't think of any options besides &quot;calling the police&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;


&lt;p&gt;[ysth], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-29 14:23:21&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-29 14:23:21&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-29 14:23:21]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Posted the Doctor poll, just as Dr. Who spontaneously came up in the cb.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-24 11:21:44&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-24 11:21:44&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-24 11:21:44]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sure.  Throw this into the mix...

&lt;pre&gt;
How I like my steak:

Raw
Rare
Medium Rare
Medium
Medium Well
Well Done
Burnt
On someone else's plate... yuck!
Inside a Happy Cow
&lt;/pre&gt;

This is, of course, loosely related to the cooking poll.  And the other one that occurred to me was &quot;How I like my eggs&quot;.  Not bad ideas, but some diversity is needed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-24 06:12:05&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-24 06:12:05&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-24 06:12:05]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So, how about the Doctor poll, then one from the quest (I'll try to find one),
then [tye]'s dancing poll, then Star Trek?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

All of which reminds me of a series I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; like a lot...
&lt;pre&gt;

Peter Davidson

David Tennant
Doctor Who?

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These two polls should probably be separated significantly... they're pretty similar.  I'd actually rather do this one first.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-24 03:06:12&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-24 03:06:12&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-24 03:06:12]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I did some homework on this one... necessarily, as I'm not actually a big fan of any of the Trek series.  IMDB has a [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0060028/fullcredits#cast|master list].
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My favorite crew member from the original Star Trek:
There are actually a fair number of consistent minor crew members... sort of.  The actor Eddie Paskey, for instance, appears in 59 episodes, and at one point is identified as &quot;Lieutenant Leslie&quot;.  According to [http://www.eddiepaskey.com/Mr_leslie_facts.htm|this reference]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He can be seen in nearly every episode from the first two seasons as well as a few from the third.  He played many scenes as a &quot;red shirt&quot;, usually the first to die when exploring a planet.  He is the only one though, to have died in one episode (&quot;Obsession&quot;) and returned in the next!  This was due to to the fact that a scene from the script that was never shot indicated that the victims were brought back to life!
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The same reference notes that he has &quot;been seen wearing a gold, blue, and red shirt&quot;, and that at one point &quot;He even played 'Mr. Connors', one of McCoy's medical assistants!&quot;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So it's kind of hard to figure out how often Paskey's appearances were Lt. Leslie, and how often they were some other token crewman (possibly slated for death).  I decided, therefore, to keep it simple, and let the monks mention oddball favorites in the comments.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I do think &quot;the computer&quot; is an interesting idea, but I don't have a good alternative for &quot;crew&quot; that would let the computer through and keep the rest of the flood out.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-23 23:18:45&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-23 23:18:45&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-23 23:18:45]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Trying to come up with left-overs for your poll, I wonder if you should include &quot;the computer&quot;.  This might require revising the term &quot;crew&quot; (perhaps &quot;character&quot;? but that tends to open the flood gates and then &quot;Harry Mudd&quot; pops up, etc.).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-23 12:08:46&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-23 12:08:46&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-23 12:08:46]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I didn't think you actually &lt;em&gt;felt&lt;/em&gt; bad about it... and I don't think I'd patronize you about it if you did.  :-)  That's just my evaluation of the poll, and one aspect of [tye]ism.  If I'd thought the poll was bad, I'd have said so beforehand.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Moving right along...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
My favorite crew member from the original Star Trek:

Captain Kirk
Mr. Spock
Dr. McCoy
Mr. Scott
Lt. Uhura
Mr. Sulu
Mr. Chekov
Yeoman Rand
Nurse Chapel
One of the Hapless Redshirts
Other
None; I can't stand that show.
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-22 20:37:51&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-22 20:37:51&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-22 20:37:51]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, I don't feel bad.  After all, the secret purpose of the poll has been fulfilled: to prove that Alton Brown is the best-loved among American geeks.  It was poll about American cooking show hosts.  I don't really think many people would claim that they learned to cook from a cooking show.  Shows are usually about refining cooking not learning how to cook in the first place.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-22 19:09:22&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-22 19:09:22&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-22 19:09:22]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Heh.  I'd suggest that a prominent part of [tye]-nature involves being subtle in a way that others don't follow.  With this poll, for instance, the joke is the suggestion that nobody actually learns to cook except by watching television.  A fair number of those who responded, however, complained of missing options, and a fair number of the others got the idea, but seemed more inclined to just talk about how they actually learned to cook.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In a sense, that's not a bad thing.  People are voting, and talking; like party games, polls are supposed to give people something to talk about.  I do think that the more general the topic, however, the easier it is to talk about.  Possibly a straight &quot;How I Learned to Cook&quot; poll would have made for more interesting conversation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The point that the poll slants heavily towards American TV is fair.  That didn't strike me as I read it either, though.  Overall, though, it's really not a bad poll at all.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-22 02:45:57&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-22 02:45:57&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-22 02:45:57]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
People seem to be enjoying it and it's getting comments and votes, so I don't
see anything shoddy about it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-22 01:50:25&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-22 01:50:25&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-22 01:50:25]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Well, that poll was a bit shoddy.  Or well, it looks like people are having fun talking about the left-out bits so that's good.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Please let at least two non-[tye] polls happen before doing this next one.  It has too much [tye]-nature to come this close to my previous one.  Some people don't really like [tye]-nature.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
When it comes to dancing,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;I have two left feet
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I've just the one foot left
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sorry can't; left my feet in my other shoes
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I sweep her off his feet
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I'm lucky to make it 3 feet w/o injury
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Keeping up with me is no mean feat
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even being at a dance I consider defeat
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;I fear it makes me look effete
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Something else is afoot
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-20 22:50:22&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-20 22:50:22&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-20 22:50:22]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It took a bit of searching, but I found this:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; Now one of this country's best-known chefs, Prudhomme has often appeared on national television. He's been seen with Bryant Gumbel on The Today Show, with Joan Lunden on Good Morning America, on CBS This Morning with Forest Sawyer, on 20/20, Live with Regis and Kathie Lee, Donahue, Late Night with David Letterman, with Tom Brokaw on NBC Nightly News, on Larry King Live, Nightwatch with Charlie Rose, and the QVC shopping channel.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I was pretty sure I knew him from TV, as I know I never read anything by him.  Not that I'm passionate about seeing him on the poll, or anything... just a name that struck me.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-20 16:56:03&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-20 16:56:03&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-20 16:56:03]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A combination of reverse chronological and most famous to most obscure (which doesn't conflict much since long-past celebs are more obscure).  I thought of Ron Popeil but figure he was nearly a duplicate to George Foreman which I liked better.  Jeff Smith was indeed a &quot;miss&quot; on my part (I've watched him).  Paul Prudhomme doesn't appear to be much of a &lt;em&gt;television&lt;/em&gt; chef -- at least I didn't turn up a cooking show series that he hosted.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I mostly learned to cook from: Rachael Ray, Alton Brown, Paula Deen, Sandra Lee, Ina Garten, Giada De Laurentiis, Bobby Flay, Emeril Lagasse, George Foreman, Martha Stewart, Jeff Smith, Julia Child, Some other TV host, I don't watch TV and so can't cook, I pretend I learned to cook without a TV.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-20 01:57:25&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-20 01:57:25&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-20 01:57:25]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I don't know any of those people - did [tye]'s list have some particular
order?  Should they just be sorted by last name, first name?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-19 23:24:44&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-19 23:24:44&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-19 23:24:44]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, yeah... and Paul Prudhomme.  Maybe Ron Popeil, for a funny option.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-19 23:21:03&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-19 23:21:03&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-19 23:21:03]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, by the way, Jeff Smith, &quot;The Frugal Gourmet&quot;, is missing.  Also, don't mix &quot;I pretend I learned to cook without a TV&quot; with any other non-TV options; that wouldn't make sense.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-19 23:14:42&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-19 23:14:42&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-19 23:14:42]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In my opinion, 7 days is plenty for almost any poll.  Go for it.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-19 22:39:45&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-19 22:39:45&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-19 22:39:45]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I got one positive /msg about the cheese in a spray can poll, but it
sounds like the nays have it.  The current current poll has been up
for not quite 8 days now; shall we have [tye]'s poll in a couple more
days?  Sooner?  Later?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-19 22:24:14&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-19 22:24:14&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-19 22:24:14]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am inclined toward non-controversial fun in polls... or at least &quot;relevant&quot; controversy, like tabs vs. spaces for indentation.  I'm also more inclined to have a poll be an actual poll, rather than a statement.  [EvanK]'s &quot;poll&quot; is basically just a political opinion, or social commentary.  Bleah.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-19 18:41:10&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-19 18:41:10&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-19 18:41:10]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I didn't nuke or rebless any polls, and I don't know any other way to remove the current poll.  So I guess you're hallucinating.  Missing: my spouse, my parent(s), my children's gastronomic disinclinations.  But that is a whole different direction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], &lt;a href=&quot;#2007-06-19 13:11:10&quot; name=&quot;2007-06-19 13:11:10&quot;&gt;[localtime://2007-06-19 13:11:10]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I'd expect some to find it humorously ironic and some to find it objectionably annoying (in several ways).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Did I halucinate a quite recent new poll (after the &quot;current&quot; poll) with just a couple of options and a link to some code related to the poll?  Then this poll got &quot;disappeared&quot;, making the then-previous poll the currently current poll?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Did I miss any of the &quot;big&quot; ones?&lt;br /&gt;
I mostly learned to cook from: Alton Brown, Rachael Ray, Paula Deen, Sandra Lee, Ina Garten, Giada De Laurentiis, Bobby Flay, Emeril Lagasse, George Foreman, Martha Stewart, Julia Child, Some other TV host, I don't watch TV and so can't cook, I pretend I learned to cook without a TV.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

What do you think of [EvanK]'s [id://621846]?
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;c&gt;
Choose wisely:
The ozone layer
Cheese in a spray can
&lt;/c&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Too few options?  Too biased?  Too uninteresting?

New poll proposal:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;c&gt;
The glass is...
half full.
half empty.
empty. Hey, I was thirsty.
Hold on, let me measure it.
a cylindrical object formed mostly from molten silicon dioxide, lacking an upper base, and containing approximately 50% hydrogen oxide with trace amounts of lead and 50% atmospheric gasses.
just another part of the illusion that our senses are all tapped into.
broken. Where's your stupid personality test now, huh?
severely lacking in my alcoholic beverage of choice.
Wait, that's not a glass! It's a small mimic!
Glass? What glass?

my social life
eating
sleeping
bathing
sex

&lt;p&gt;Second idea:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;c&gt;I backup my files:

daily
weekly
monthly
yearly
frequently
infrequently
I knew I was forgetting something
when it's too late

Yes, of course.
Yes, but I'm not telling you.
No; never knew it existed!
No. I don't do Geek Codes.

I think the awards ceremony was today; anybody have a quick new poll?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], [localtime://2007-02-25 17:54:33]&lt;br /&gt;
Yeah, sorry about that.  I was thinking of polls with naturally finite options, because those don't get as many annoying complaints.  That one seemed like a good idea, and when I checked, I found that the actual awards were around the corner.  Under normal circumstances, I'd have checked the age of the current poll before posting.  As it was, I just went with [ysth]'s approval.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Hey... wait!  I'm &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; sorry!  I was led astray by the perfidy of others!  &lt;strong&gt;DAMN YOU, [YSTH]!!!&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2007-02-20 05:13:06]&lt;br /&gt;
Mea maxima culpa.  I encouraged [Petruchio] to put it up right away given the new poll's
timebound nature.  I thought the UFO poll had been up for longer (I should have checked),
and I thought its votes and comments had tapered off; I see the latter is not true&amp;mdash;there
are new comments from today that I hadn't noticed.  I'll try to do a better job of checking
my impressions against observable fact.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[jacques], [localtime://2007-02-19 23:38:28]&lt;br /&gt;
I am not in favor of polls being removed early, unless there's a good reason. The last one was up for only &lt;b&gt;4 days&lt;/b&gt;... 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[yitzchak], [localtime://2007-02-19 23:03:28]&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], [localtime://2007-01-08 02:22:52]&lt;br /&gt;
I'm of the general notion that polls are better off left simple.  When you focus your attention on something limited, there's a natural tendency to add doo-dads... I'd prefer to avoid that.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Incidentally, while on the simple end of the spectrum, I wouldn't mind a poll whose options were simply:
&lt;c&gt;
fork
thread
&lt;/c&gt;
I'm curious as to which folks prefer.  I'm not quite sure how to phrase the question, however.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2007-01-07 00:44:22]&lt;br /&gt;
I'm thinking of a poll titled &quot;I laughed, I cried, I ...&quot; with choices taken from what a google search shows following that phrase.  Is that too uninteresting?  I'd leave out some of the cruder phrases...though I'm thinking about having a gimmick to hide some options by default and provide a &quot;blue version&quot; link to show them all.  Ideas for how to label such a link?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], [localtime://2007-01-01 12:26:53]&lt;br /&gt;

It's interesting that my poll is credited to my &quot;Nodes You Wrote&quot; page (which makes sense), but that it doesn't increase the total number.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this is a bug?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Or is for this reason that the tilde '~' appears in the text &lt;c&gt;These nodes all have stuff by liverpole (showing 501-514 out of ~513)&lt;/c&gt;?

Portugal and most of Europe would be OK with an American-centric poll like that. We see a bunch of American movies anyway.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[planetscape], [localtime://2006-11-08 17:34:32]&lt;br /&gt;
I am working on an idea: &quot;In &lt;i&gt;PerlMonks: The Motion Picture&lt;/i&gt;, the Vote Fairy would best be portrayed by...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
I have a list of actors/actresses (and options like Claymation/Animatronic/CGI. I wanted to pick actresses who've played roles like the White Witch from Chronicles of Narnia, the Borg Queen, Wednesday Addams, the child vampire from Interview with the Vampire, and a couple others &quot;cross type&quot;. I wanted to link the names to these roles (which I haven't quite gotten 'round to yet - I'll post back here as I expand on the idea).&lt;br /&gt;
My primary concern was that it would be too &quot;America-centric&quot;, and I discussed this rather briefly with [davido].&lt;br /&gt;
Comments, links, (w|cr)iticisms are all welcome. :-)&lt;br /&gt;

Speed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For a humorously literal change of direction at the end, you might offer, 'seeds'.  You'd need to drop the 'is' from the subject, if you wanted that, though.  I'm sure there's a patch joke here, somewhere, too... though that seems like, &quot;What I'd look in for a pumpkin&quot;.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Personally, while it doesn't fit the computer-related motif, I'm keen on aerodynamics.  ;-)

Some people dislike the seasonal polls, while I don't mind them, and actually feel that &quot;current events&quot; (including holidays) are reasonable fodder for polls.  But how about we come up with something a little more unusual.  Possible topics:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;This Halloween my computer will be dressed up as... (An Amiga, A Commodore 64, An Altair, Hal 2000, A Cyborg, A Perlish Obfu, Me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What I look for in a pumpkin is... (symmetry, efficiency, maintainability, smallest footprint, functionality, objective orientation, friendly user interface)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&quot;_______&quot; or treat: (Malware, Spyware, Adware, Trojan Horse, Virus, Time Bomb)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...Just a few off the cuff possibilities, but &lt;b&gt;&lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/b&gt; other suggestions would probably be superior. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[planetscape], [localtime://2006-10-23 06:45:30]&lt;br /&gt;
Shall we go with the seasonal [id://578419|&quot;This Halloween I will be dressed up as&quot;] by [marto] even though something similar ([id://504009]) was done last year?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[planetscape], [localtime://2006-10-16 03:32:30]&lt;br /&gt;
Would the &quot;Note&quot; work in the optional Prologue field?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2006-10-16 03:05:16]&lt;br /&gt;
If an epilogue field existed, the challenge would be to make any epilogues neutral enough as to not influence the vote.  Most polls are probably better without too much 'documentation', imho.  But maybe an epilogue note could be implemented via one of the poll gimmik features.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2006-10-15 22:33:20]&lt;br /&gt;
Please welcome [liverpole] to [pollsters].&lt;p&gt;
There's no place to put the &quot;Note...&quot; bit; I thought about adding an epilogue field, but I'm not sure this case warrants it.

do blocks
block eval
array slices
qw operator
next and last
trailing commas
statement modifiers
variable interpolation

&lt;c&gt;Note, I'm not talking about CPAN, the testing infrastructure or anything &quot;big&quot;. I'm interesting in what makes Perl so nice to use when you're working at the coalface.&lt;/c&gt;

How about [McDarren]'s [id://573505]?&lt;br /&gt;

The most &lt;b&gt;unusual&lt;/b&gt; place I have logged into Perl Monks from is:&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;c&gt;
my home
my home, whilst taking a bath
somebody else's home

my car, whilst driving
a train

Anybody got a poll to suggest?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2006-09-21 01:40:16]&lt;br /&gt;
They don't quite fit, and I didn't get around to /msg'ing [sacked], and s/he hasn't been around to get a /msg anyway, so I'm just going with the original options.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2006-09-19 02:09:38]&lt;br /&gt;
My only concern is that there are two different authors involved, and I don't think any collaboration has gone on.  Maybe we should get the original author's thoughts on the added suggestions.  Or maybe that's taking things too seriously. ;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2006-09-19 00:59:17]&lt;br /&gt;
Opinions on the suggested additions in [id://573473]?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

Added a Pollsters' Nodelet designed by [planetscape].  Enable it with [Nodelet Settings] if you want.

&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], [localtime://2006-09-03 10:34:10]&lt;br /&gt;
I added the &quot;other&quot; option back in.  People get grouchy without 
that.  Sorry I didn't get to that while it was still on the wiki.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2006-09-03 06:42:39]&lt;br /&gt;

Ok, updated list, still with 26.  Is that too many?

I'm working on adding a &quot;prologue&quot; field to polls that will display between the title and the choices,
for us to put a NSFW warning in.

Most infamous &quot;last words&quot;:
Watch this!
Now hit enter.
Clip the blue wire first.
You can do that with string [doc://eval].
I'll just reformat it and reinstall everything.
Woops!

Cutting Red Meat, This Modern World, ones with a lower page rank (Penny and Aggie, Dr McNinja, PBF, Alien Loves Predator, Maakies, Shabot 6000, and Terinu), and all the mnftiu.cc ones except &quot;get your war on&quot; gets us down to 30.  Next I'll try to go through and find ones that are no longer being updated, but that won't be today.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2006-08-23 19:04:20] &lt;br /&gt;
I'll see if I can grab something from the quest in the meantime.  I'll get to it Thursday AM PDT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2006-08-23 18:25:02]&lt;br /&gt;
Should we start a different poll sometime in the Thursday-Sunday timeframe to give us more time to think about the comic poll?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2006-08-23 17:31:11]&lt;br /&gt;
Re NSFW maybe add a gimmick number that adds a block of text above the choices?
&lt;p&gt;
FWIW, the people I asked for favorite comics who came up with my list did have some
overlap with [Petruchio]'s list, but not a lot.  I don't really read web or print comics, so I'm not aware of what's web-only.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], [localtime://2006-08-23 05:05:51]&lt;br /&gt;
Good point... I don't know how best to handle the NSFW issue.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My list is simply a mix of two &quot;most popular&quot; lists I found (one of which was in Wikipedia), and a bunch of comics I read.  I would say 30 is as many options as I'd ever give; I'm not sure this requires as many as that.  As for the order... so long as Schlock is first, I'm mostly indifferent.  ;-D
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
My personal preference would be to keep to web-only comics.  Strips like This Modern World and Red Meat are really print comics which can be found on the web.  Might as well add Garfield to the list.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Thanks for adding the links, too, [ysth].
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2006-08-22 21:24:09]&lt;br /&gt;
Some of these are pretty graphic (as one might expect).  Should we have a &quot;links may be NSFW&quot; warning?  How many options is too many?  Select the top X of these based on google page rank?  Sort by page rank?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

Feel free to add some.  These should all be links, in 
the poll.  If I wind up posting, I suppose I'll add them. 
If any of you feel like doing it, though, don't let me 
stop you. (updated: links added by [ysth]) ;-)

write some cool but completely useless modules like Lingua::Romana::Perligata
inhabit the Chatterbox
write a three page answer to the newest Hash-of-Hashes question
start some flamewars on [http://slashdot.org|Slashdot]

play a tetris clone

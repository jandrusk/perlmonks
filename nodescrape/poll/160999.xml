The coolest language ever. I may never go outside again.
Like Perl5, only slicker.
Whatever I configure it to be. My own private Perl.
Even more annoying to uptight language grannies.
Something I worry about when it arrives.
The leverage Parrot needs to conquer the world.
A mixed bag.  Some ideas I love, some I fear.
Frustrating; I've worked hard to learn Perl 5, dang it!
Finished just in time to teach to my grandkids.
Like APL, only not as easy to read. Hmm... where's the &amp;#8716; key?
Perl's downfall.  Woe!  Despair!
None of the above; see my rant below.
I'm waiting to hear what paco thinks.</field>

Test??? There's a test?!? Oh. I didn't study!!!
Tests? What do you mean 'tests'?
Tests? I don't need no stinkin' tests-my code is flawless, you insensitive clod!

Between 1 and 100
Between 100 and 1000
Between 1000 and 10,000
Between 10,000 and 100,000
Between 100,000 and 1,000,000
More than 1,000,000
Someone else lost a bet, and paid up by writing the tests for me.

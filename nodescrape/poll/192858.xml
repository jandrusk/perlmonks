Perfect for me.
Okay, but my first choice was taken.
Regrettable; all the good ones were taken.
Chosen too quickly; I should have given it more thought.
Poorly considered; people assume I'm a doofus.
Too long for the CB; what was I thinking?
My real name; blame my parents.
Pretty bad, since I totally lack creativity.
Coincidentally also the pseudonym of a local serial killer.
At least better than something awful like 'Petruchio'.
Not well-characterized by any of these poll options.

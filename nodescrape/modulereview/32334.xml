&lt;H4&gt;Description&lt;/H4&gt;                                         
The Data::Flow module                                        
allows you to specify a hash of "recipes"                    
that fetch or manipulate data.                               
Each recipe has a name (the hash key),                       
which you can use to set the input or fetch the output       
value of the recipe                                          
using the Data::Flow &lt;B&gt;set&lt;/B&gt; and &lt;B&gt;get&lt;/B&gt; methods.      
A recipe can depend on                                       
other prerequisite recipes,                                  
which means that the input of one recipe                     
can be taken from the output of other recipes.               
You can use this to create a                                 
hierarchy (or other structure) of dependent recipes.         
The cool thing is that                                       
you then call for a specific type of output,                 
and the data flows from its input recipes                    
through all of the dependent recipes to your output,         
without you having to code the calling structure directly.   
This allows for a lot of flexibility,                        
because you can manipulate your calling structure            
by changing your hash recipes and dependencies,              
not by having to find all of the places                      
that subroutine &lt;I&gt;X&lt;/I&gt; is called in your code.           
&lt;H4&gt;Why should you use it?&lt;/H4&gt;                              
The Data::Flow module would be especially appropriate        
if your data can be processed in a lot of complicated        
and inter-related ways,                                      
and you want a lot of flexibility                            
in how you'll want it processed,                             
now or in the future.                                       
&lt;H4&gt;Why should you NOT use it?&lt;/H4&gt;                          
For straightforward processing of your data,                 
the recipe structure of Data::Flow can be overkill.          
It's not as intuitively obvious                              
as just hacking the code.                                    
&lt;H4&gt;Related Modules&lt;/H4&gt;                                     
The [C::Scan] module                                         
uses the Data::Flow module.                                  
(Both were written by Ilya.)                                 
&lt;H4&gt;Example&lt;/H4&gt;                                             
The Data::Flow documentation                                 
provides an okay example,                                    
but looking at the C::Scan module will                       
teach you more about using Data::Flow powerfully.

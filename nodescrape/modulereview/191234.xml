I'm really just posting this in response to anyone searching for information on interfacing with Authorize.net.  At last look, the only PerlMonks thread on the subject was [Interfacing to Authorize.Net], which is basically a collection of makeshift solutions to a pretty common problem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Anyway, [Business::OnlinePayment::AuthorizeNet] works really well (for now anyway, lets hope the maintainers keep it up!) and fellow monks should keep it in mind when pitching for an e-commerce job.

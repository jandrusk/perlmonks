Sman is an enhanced version of 'apropos' and 'man -k', or a cross between perldoc and grep. I use it all the time because of its unique features: It supports complex natural language text searches; it will produce an extract of the man page with the searched text highlighted; it allows searches by manpage section, title, body, or filename; it indexes the entire manpage; lastly, it uses a prebuilt index for extremely fast searches. &lt;p&gt;
Sman has just one dependency: SWISH-E 2.4 or above. SWISH-E is a great search tool too. &lt;p&gt;
You can download Sman via CPAN. After you install it, you need to run sman-update---this will build the necessary index to enable it to work properly. On the cmd, just type: /usr/local/bin/sman-update --verbose. That's it! I think you'll enjoy it as much as I do. &lt;p&gt;

Data::Dumper is in the standard Perl distribution.  it's probably the easiest module to use, just issue a 'use Data::Dumper' call, and then either print to STDOUT ( with 'print Dumper \@foo ') or stick into some html used by an application ( i prefer to wrap it in &amp;lt;pre&amp;gt; tags, so the output isn't mangled.)  

Data::Dumper also works keenly with objects, and gives you the class into which your variable is blessed. (with makes debugging object relations really quick.)

I've been using the GD module for a few months for creating dynamic images for our website, and I must say: I couldn't think of anything better&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
GD offers a set of functions to draw lines, points, brushes, text and use existing imagefiles, and offers output functions to output the image as JPEG or PNG (GIF support has been removed due to the fileformat patent-thing :(  ).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Some people have also written subclasses like GD::Graph3d (I believe), which offers a nice, clean interface to draw piecharts, linegraphs and bargraphs. I've never really used these though.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Like the POD documentation says: "
GD.pm is a port of Thomas Boutell's gd graphics library.", and I'm happy that Lincoln D. Stein ported it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

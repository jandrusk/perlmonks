&lt;p&gt; I used this module to write a testing suite for an SNMP-enabled application
written by my company: it worked well and I was able to do what I wanted with a
minimum of fuss.

&lt;p&gt; One thing that impressed me was that I was able to construct the
appropriate objects necessary to do an SNMP get on the command-line, or take
the care necessary to do it right, in a script.

&lt;p&gt; I do seem to remember having trouble with the names of sysDescr values
which I had to work around, but that may well have been my own
misunderstanding.

&lt;p&gt; The module also lacked a copying constructor, this hurt when I wanted
to make a copy of an SNMP::Varbind object:  I had to resort to a simple
(ie non-deep) copy and hope it worked.

&lt;p&gt; IIRC, the module also comes packaged with the UC Davis SNMP code, which
is pretty handy.

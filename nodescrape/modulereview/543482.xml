&lt;p&gt;Function proxy and uri are very poorly named. what does proxy mean? it can easily make people think that it is the server, should be called endpoint as it is perceived in the entire SOAP world. uri is hardly needed, but all examples in SOAP::Lite doc have that, you really cannot easily guess what should be passed in. When those two goes together, it becomes worse than anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is easy to use after you stuggled pass the point, but that struggling really shouldn't be there with any well defined and documented computer program.&lt;/p&gt;

  Considered by [DrHyde]: merge with [543674] if possible. titles are identical, anonymous authors probably identical  &lt;br /&gt;
  Unconsidered by [Arunbear]: node merging isn't supported; Keep: 5, Edit: 21, Reap: 7
&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</field>

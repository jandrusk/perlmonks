&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;
This is an excellent package for anyone who wants to add
MP3 listing and streaming to Apache.  The installation
directions are simple and straight forward.  There are
a number of configuration options to change the behaviour
of the module.  It also uses MP3::Info to extract id3 tag
info for the listings and this information can be cached for
better performance.  I have nearly 5 Gig. of mp3s on a k6-2 450 
and speed isn't an issue.

&lt;h2&gt;The Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
I had originally installed this on a stock Redhat Apache/Mod_Perl
setup (mod_perl loaded dynamically).  For some reason this 
played havoc on the stability of the module. Once I 
recompiled Apache and Mod_Perl from source, it behaved 
flawlessly.  
&lt;p&gt;
The look of the generated pages is controled via
a cascading style sheet.  While this simplifies altering
the apearance, it doesn't allow for an ultimate in configurability.
&lt;p&gt;
And lastly, somebody else wrote it.
For those of you who had considered writing one, the task
has been done. :)</field>

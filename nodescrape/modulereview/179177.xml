This module makes it easy to ascertain if a credit card number is intrinsically valid.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It computes the checksum contained in the card number to determine if the card number has been entered correctly, and can report the type of card that the number came from.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
This make it possible to determine if the user has entered the card number and type of card correctly.  For example, a Perl/Tk script could be used by your phone support staff to make certain that the credit card information passed to them by the user seeking assistance has been transmitted correctly before attempting to log charges against it.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Note: One caveat I didn't see in the readme or perldocs:  The credit card numbers passed into the routines can not contain embedded dashes.  You must first either change the dashes to spaces, or remove them.  Either way works fine.&lt;br&gt;

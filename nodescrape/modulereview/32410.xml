&lt;p&gt;[cpan://Date::Manip] is often referred to as a large,
monolithic and impractical module. And at almost three times
the size of [cpan://Date::Calc] (which is itself referred
to as large and monolithic), it is certainly a large module.
However, it provides some useful high-level functions, including
very flexible parsing capabilities.

&lt;h2&gt;The Good&lt;/h2&gt;

I have found Date::Manip to be useful primarily for its
date parsing capabilities. It can parse many different
human-readable date specifications. You can say things like:
&lt;code&gt;
	ParseDate('today at midnight')
	ParseDate('in 3 weeks')
	ParseDate('1 year ago')
	ParseDate('3rd monday in october')
	ParseDate('3rd monday in october at 5 pm')
	ParseDate('in 3 hours')
	ParseDate('december 3, 1970')
&lt;/code&gt;
and they will all parse correctly. [cpan://Date::Manip]
also handles concepts of work days and holidays, date deltas
(for example, "in 3 weeks" can be parsed both as a date and
as a delta), recurrent events, and named events. From its internal
representation, it can output dates in any format you may
need.&lt;p&gt;
The documentation is quite extensive and detailed, although
it is somewhat confusing in parts.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
It is a very large module.&lt;p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The Bottom Line&lt;/h2&gt;
If you need powerful date parsing capabilities, or other
high-level functions (like recurrence, work/holiday days, etc.),
[cpan://Date::Manip] is for you. For most other things it
may be overkill.</field>

&lt;p&gt;[http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Carp::Clan|From the docs]:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote cite="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Carp::Clan"&gt;&lt;p&gt;In case you just want to ward off all error messages from the module in which you “&lt;code&gt;use Carp::Clan&lt;/code&gt;”, i.e., if you want to make all error messages or warnings to appear to originate from where your module was called (this is what you usually used to “&lt;code&gt;use Carp;&lt;/code&gt;” for &lt;tt&gt;;-)&lt;/tt&gt;), instead of in your module itself (which is what you can do with a “[doc://die]” or “[doc://warn]” anyway), you do not need to provide a pattern, the module will automatically provide the correct one for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I discovered this module, I would play silly games with &lt;code&gt;local $Carp::CarpLevel = $Carp::CarpLevel + 1&lt;/code&gt; sprinkled all over the place. Not only was that annoying, it also hatefully causes [doc://Carp] to emit verbose messages. Now I just &lt;code&gt;use Carp::Clan&lt;/code&gt; and things work as I meant them to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that’s not the module’s only use – but that alone makes the module worthwhile to use everywhere, even if you don’t have a “clan” of modules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My only question is: why is this not part of the core? Why indeed doesn’t [doc://Carp] itself work that way?&lt;/p&gt;</field>

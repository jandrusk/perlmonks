# This script is a fun joke you can play on coworkers
# who leave their terminals unattended.  It prints a
# fake shell prompt, and every time the victim presses
# a key, it outputs the next letter of the sentence you
# set at the top.  At the end of the sentence, it prints
# a "command not found" error and gives them another fake
# prompt.
#
# For best results, add a line that runs this script to the
# end of the victim's .profile

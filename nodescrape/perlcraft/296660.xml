Update: added rules
Update: on my darwin i set up the relevant rule with

    ipfw add 65500 divert 65500 tcp from me to any via en0

replace with your iface of choice, naturally. I haven't set this up on
linux (yet), but I know divert sockets were ported at some point...
ciao ciao!

This little script was hell to write, because every time i didn't do the
firewall rule right, and had a fix for the script, my netinfo server
couldn't be contacted... this ment that i couldn't run

    ipfw flush

regardless, i've finally made it. It now prioritises using a size based
queue, which is really nothing compared to what you can do. Suprisingly
it's not a resource hog, and there's still some stuff to implement, such
as timeout based dropping using a journal (the purger is written, but
not the logger), and priority queue clipping using mapl's janus heaps...

I guess i'll prioritize the cmp sub so that it puts tcp SYN packets, and
non piggybacked ACKS, aswell as short ICMP and UDP at the top
automatically. Then I'll prioritise by service...

so far only the heap has made bittorrent and perlmonks chat possible at
the same time, even when running several bts at a time... I must say I
was surprised.

Replace "#print" with ";print" for debugging info.

Unresolved bug: within the SIGIO handler recv will sometimes return
undefined, but the loop check doesn't pick it up, so pack complains. I
have no idea why.

Bah. Enough yak, here's the stuff:

use strict;
use warnings;

use Socket;
use Time::HiRes qw(time sleep alarm);
use Fcntl qw(F_SETOWN F_GETFL F_SETFL O_ASYNC O_NONBLOCK);
use Array::Heap;
#use Array::Heap2; # same thing, with a different namespacs

### KNOWN BUGS
# this code is very dirty and hackish, may be resolved in the future

### CHANGES
# added real rules to order the heaps. A simple API and examples at the bottom...
# currently aggressively user oriented, with a bit of space for standard unixish servers

### TODO
# score changes dynamically based on time... Instability in heap could
# be negligeable at this point, as TCP is fault tolerant and UDP
# shouldn't care. ICMP should a have high enough priority
#
# purge using timeout, not just by clipping the queue
#
# both of these are theoretically solveable using references within the queue,
# so that you could undef and change the value of the referants (thingys) in
# the heap itself. I wonder if make_heap instead of push_heap would be much worse.
# This way we could take a reference to an element in the heap.

# aggressive purging minimizes wasted bandwidth:
    # have an x second maximum queue life (to be implemented)
    # purge heap size:
    #   if (overflow){
    #       reverse order
    #       reverse heapify
    #       reverse pop
    #       reverse order
    #   }

# This is a Zsh script for downloading, building, and
# installing SDL-Perl 1.17.4.  I wrote it for a friend who
# was having a hard time installing SDL-Perl, and I
# figured there might be someone on here who would find it
# useful.  I didn't want all this work to go to waste,
# afterall.  
#
# Think of it as a poor man's qx(apt-get install libsdl-perl), 
# and get it while it's hot, because it only works for
# SDL-Perl 1.17.4.  You won't want to use it after Dave
# releases a newer version.  (At least not without modifications).

# -------------------------------------------------------
#
# In order for this script to work, you must have the
# following things installed:
#
# [ debian packages ]
#   - sudo
#   - wget
#   - libsdl1.2-dev
#   - libsdl1.2-debian
#   - zsh
#   - and the rest of the usual suspects
#     like g++, autoconf, patch, etc.

# After you have all that set up, just run this script and
# it will download and install a pretty decent SDL-Perl
# for you.  

# You might not like the way it does certain things, but I
# think this script is layed out simply enough that you
# can make certain tweaks to it that will make it just
# right for your system.

# [ extra libs ]
#   x SDL_gfx-2.0.3.tar.gz
#   x SDL_image-1.2.2.tar.gz
#   x SDL_mixer-1.2.3.tar.gz
#   x SDL_net-1.2.4.tar.gz
#   x SDL_ttf-2.0.5.tar.gz
#   o smpeg-0.4.4.tar.gz	:-( c++ was uncooperative )
# 
# [ gl from sgi ]
#   o ogl-sample.20000807.tgz	mesa is good enough for now

# This is a simple script that dumps a hexadecimal 
# representation of a file
# It was origginally written in C, so it suffers from some 
# C syntax (mostly `for' loops could probably be redone
# in a more `perlish' way and the use of ternary operator 
# ?: is quite ugly). It also overuses printf's where a more 
# elegant solution with `unpack' could be found.
# Never-the-less, it did the job that I needed to do, so
# here it is for all to see (and maybe even use).

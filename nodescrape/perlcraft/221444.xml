Just thought i would share this... i created it after
finding not finding anything with this functionality
(a while ago).  It was made for my personal needs 
initially, and was doctored up a few weeks later to
be somewhat customizable.  Its about a year old.

I have a cronjob that runs it every day:
0 1 * * * /home/conteb/cvs/snapshot.pl phynd /var/www/snapshots /var/cvs &gt;&gt; /var/www/snapshots/snapshots.log 2&gt;&amp;1

Sample can be found at http://www.phynd.net/snapshots/

#!/usr/bin/perl
#
# Create nightly cvs snapshots of project in a 
# repository, only saving the snapshot if the module 
# has changed.
# 
# TODO: Error checking is by no means complete.
#
use Date::Manip;

use strict;
use warnings;

sub printHelp; # print basic help screen

my $tempdir = '/tmp/';
my $maxdayspast = 90; # will only check 90 days in the past before recording.

# Can take 1 - 3 args - project name and dir to put resulting snapshot
my $project = shift(@ARGV) or printHelp;
my $dest = shift(@ARGV) or printHelp;

chdir $tempdir;
if (defined $server) {
    (`cvs -d $server co -P $project 2&gt;&amp;1`=~/cannot find module/) and

# at different times create slightly different sized tarballs (on my

# and run a diff on the two trees to see if there is a difference.

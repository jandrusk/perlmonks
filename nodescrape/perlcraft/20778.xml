# This peice of code recursivly searches directories
# untill it hits the end of its tree for files that
# have been modified in the last 10 days. In this case
# Im only searching for mp3 files....but that can easily
# be hacked out.
#
# It then symlinks the final directory of the tree from where
# the file that was modified lately into your $ndir. It then
# creates another text file that specifies exactly what files
# were updated lately in that directory that was symlinked. Hrm
# I think thats it...
#
# This was done so I could move my rips out of incoming/ 
# as soon as they were put in there, and still know what
# I had uploaded in the past few days. ( Previously I kept 
# them in the incoming/ directory till I Made sure they were
# all ok rips.

Until loops are just the opposite of [while loops|whiles].  If the control statement evaluates to false code within the loop is executed once and repeated until the control statement tests to true.&lt;BR&gt;
Heres a quick example:
&lt;PRE&gt;
$year=1900;
until($year==2000){
   print "Mission-critical electronics working in the year $year\n";
   #now it works;
   $year++;
}
print "Not working anymore\n";
&lt;/PRE&gt;
As you can see the mission-critical electronics work until the year 2000.&lt;BR&gt;
I suggest if you've just survived that harrowing ordeal you learn all about [do while loops]

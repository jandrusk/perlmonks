&lt;h1&gt;&lt;tt&gt;/borg&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;


&lt;p&gt;
If someone is being excessively offensive and disruptive in the 
[id://236794|Chatterbox], some measure of peace can be restored by 
sending that person to the "time-out box" to cool off.
This function is called &lt;i&gt;borg&lt;/i&gt;ing a user.
It is invoked by the &lt;b&gt;&lt;tt&gt;/borg&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/b&gt; command, so that is how
it is often written in conversation.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For obvious reasons, not everybody can invoke this command.
It is reserved for a specially deputized group of monks known as
[Power Users].
These are monks of impeccable integrity and reputation (we mean
&lt;i&gt;real&lt;/i&gt; reputation, not XP); they are expected to be
extremely judicious in their use of this power, erring always on
the side of &lt;i&gt;[wp://laissez-faire]&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
A user who has been &lt;tt&gt;/borg&lt;/tt&gt;ed is said to be 
"in the belly of the borg". 
A list of all currently &lt;tt&gt;/borg&lt;/tt&gt;ed users can 
be seen in the [id://56087] node.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The amount of time one remains in the [id://56087] is determined by 
the person who executes the &lt;b&gt;&lt;tt&gt;/borg&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/b&gt; command.
The default duration is 10 minutes, so that is the typical stay.
Otherwise, if the [power users|power user] gives a value for this duration,
it is usually quite high &amp;mdash; on the order of 1 to 7 days.
(You also occasionally see someone &lt;tt&gt;/borg&lt;/tt&gt;ed for a very short period of time &amp;mdash; mere seconds &amp;mdash; just for comical effect.)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Normally, when someone is &lt;tt&gt;/borg&lt;/tt&gt;ed, a message is sent
to the Chatterbox saying
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;i&gt;[NodeReaper] has swallowed (so-and-so)&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This merely indicates that a [Power Users|Power User] has executed
judgement on that monk.  It has nothing to do with
the fact that [id://409197|reaped] nodes become the possession
of the [NodeReaper].

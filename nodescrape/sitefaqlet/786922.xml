2009-08-10 [jdporter] converted to this faqlet from [id://786917], as [Settings Nodes] is really the best list. [id://17642], which was originally named "How do I change my preferences?", and pertained to all of the Settings Nodes, now pertains only to [User Settings].
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
See [Settings Nodes] for a list of the pages where you can set various preferences. Each page has its own documentation.
If the explanation of a page is not present on the page itself, look for a &lt;b&gt;Help&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;this&amp;nbsp;page&lt;/b&gt; link in the upper right corner.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H2&gt;I want to ask a question of the Perl Monks; where do I start?&lt;/H2&gt;
&lt;!-- title edited by BigLug --&gt;

If you have a Perl-related question, you've come to the 
right place. In order for you to get the quickest and 
most useful response, here are just a few tips to get 
you started.

&lt;H3&gt;Register&lt;/H3&gt;

You can post a question as the [Anonymous Monk], but 
[id://156908|registering] will let you do several
other useful things, like use the
[id://17989|Chatterbox].
(You can discuss your questions with other monks
in the Chatterbox; and if you've [Seekers of Perl Wisdom|posted] a question, PerlMonks can notify you whenever you get any replies.)

It's free and painless to [id://156908|register] and 
you will not be subjected to spam or other annoyances.

&lt;h3&gt;Be prepared to post without embarrassment&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Read &lt;b&gt;[id://17558]&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;[id://174051]&lt;/b&gt; as well as the other entries in the [id://483077] section of the [PerlMonks FAQ].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
In addition, individual monks have compiled tips for posters:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[id://20443] by [Ovid]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[id://50427] by [danger]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[id://264485] by [gmax]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;H3&gt;Go to Seekers of Perl Wisdom&lt;/H3&gt;

[Seekers of Perl Wisdom] is the main section for asking 
questions of the Monks. In order to post a question, you 
need to find this section somehow. Clicking on the link 
above is one way. Another way is to go to the link at the 
very top of every page.

&lt;P&gt;Once you've reached the right page, there is a form 
at the end of the page where you can submit your question. 
If you haven't yet done so, now would be a good time to read the
[id://17558].

&lt;H3&gt;That's all!&lt;/H3&gt;

If you've registered, you can [id://786919|set up] your [id://1072|user settings]
to send you a private whenever a reply to your question is posted. 
Then you can just log back in periodically to see if you've gotten a reply.

&lt;P&gt;If you've posted as an [Anonymous Monk] then you can go 
to the [Newest Nodes] section and check to see if anyone 
has replied to your question.  (NOTE: Each question must be 
approved by a moderator before you'll be able to view it!)
Every question eventually gets a reply.
Most get responses within a few minutes, 
depending on how busy the Monks are.
(They &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; volunteer Monks, after all!)

&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Back to the [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;

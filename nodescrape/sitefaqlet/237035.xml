&lt;h1&gt;Using the Simple Search&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
At the top of almost every page on PerlMonks is a search box.
This lets you easily search for nodes by title.&lt;br&gt;

If you enter a string which is the exact title of exactly one node,
you will be taken directly to that node.&lt;br&gt;

If there are multiple nodes with that exact title,
you will be presented with a list of those nodes.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
If no nodes are found with the exact title queried, 
then Simple Search conveniently falls through to [id://590032|Super Search],
which executes your query as a title search.
&lt;/p&gt;

This nodelet displays the choices for the current poll and allows you
to cast your vote.  If you choose to not enable this nodelet, you can
still find the current poll at the top of [id://1609].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
PerlMonks polls are administered by [pollsters] and aim to be light-hearted yet relevant to the those who frequent the Monastery.  They're clearly not scientific studies, and are not intended to gather useful information.  However, they can be a look into the lighter side of Perl.&lt;/p&gt;

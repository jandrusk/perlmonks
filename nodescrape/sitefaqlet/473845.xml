&lt;h1&gt;Linking to Copyrighted Materials&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently monks post [id://43037|links] to offsite materials that may be helpful to others here at the Monastery.  This is fine so long as such links don't infringe on applicable copyrights.  Please be aware that occasionally one finds dishonest websites that publish materials violating copyrights.  PerlMonks is home to monks of many professions.  Some of our brethren are accomplished authors who have written books that we as a community have embraced as highly valuable resources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We ask that as upstanding monks everyone using  this site respect applicable copyright laws by refraining from posting links to pirate sites.  One example of a potential abuse would be posting a link to a site hosting O'Reilly CD Bookshelf materials in a way that infringes on O'Reilly's copyright.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, just don't do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Posting such links violates PerlMonks policy.
The [Janitors] will remove such links whenever they find them; and vigilant monks (of level 6 and above) should use the [id://326922|consideration system] to bring such violations to the [janitors]' attention.&lt;/p&gt;
 --&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;

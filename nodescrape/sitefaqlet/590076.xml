Monks who have attained [id://17645] can moderate site content.
The Approval Nodelet contains controls for approving posts into [id://237057|sections],
frontpaging nodes, [id://92975|considering] nodes for editing or deletion
and voting on consideration requests.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The Approval Nodelet contains three important tools:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moderation&lt;/strong&gt;
allows you to approve a node for its section, and if it's good, for [the Monastery Gates] (the "front page") as well. For more info, see [id://17688] and [id://29730].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consideration&lt;/strong&gt;
is how you ask the [janitors] to take a look at nodes which have something seriously wrong.
You type in a message describing the problem and a suggested fix, and submit the form. 
See [id://92975] for all the poop.
Also read the all-important [id://326922]
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Section Reassignment&lt;/strong&gt;
is for nodes that are in the wrong place.
If a node hasn't been approved yet, you can move it to a different section.
If it has already been approved, but for the wrong section, you can
"consider" the node with a message about which section it should be moved to.
Since [janitors] can unapprove nodes, this will free up the node to allow some Friar 
(like you!) to re-assign it and approve it into the correct section.
There are some limitations on which sections nodes can be moved between; see
[id://92975] for details.
&lt;p&gt;
Note that you must never attempt to move and approve a node in the same step! Or even two steps!
You must follow this sequence very carefully:
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Move the node (change its assigned section, and submit). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; &lt;b&gt;Reload the page&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Approve the node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

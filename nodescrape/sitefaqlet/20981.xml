&lt;h1&gt;How is the PerlMonks FAQ maintained?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Members of the [SiteDocClan|Site Documentation Clan] have the ability
to edit and add to the contents of the [PerlMonks FAQ] section.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
[SiteDocClan] members are always on the lookout for ways
to improve the documentation at [id://131|PerlMonks], both
in quantity and quality.  Ordinary Monks have input to this
process as well.  Ideas for new documents, and alerts to
where existing documentation can be improved, are always
welcome. 
To submit such requests, 
[msg://SiteDocClan|send a message to SiteDocClan].
All of the SDC members will see your message.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
To deal with the complexity of managing the [id://131|Monastery]'s
documentation, the [SiteDocClan] have a number
of wikis they use to plan and coordinate their activities:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;dl&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;The &lt;b&gt;[id://174180|SiteDocClan wiki]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 is a general discussion forum for the Clan. They use it bandy about ideas for proposed new documents or document changes, for example, as well as SDC business not directly relating to document creation/modification.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;The &lt;b&gt;[id://240586]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 contains the SiteDocClan's documentation style guide, some node creation functions, and various other resources.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;dt&gt;The &lt;b&gt;[id://237008|SDC To-Do wiki]&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/dt&gt;&lt;dd&gt;&lt;p&gt;
is the Clan's laundry list of things that need to be done.
Historically, items don't get added to this until the moment the SDC member is about to go do it, but that's OK.
Over time, this wiki becomes a log of these activities.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/dd&gt;

&lt;/dl&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
You need to be a member of [SiteDocClan] in order to access these wikis, of course.
&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;hr/&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;

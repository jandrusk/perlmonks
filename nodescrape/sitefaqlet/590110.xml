This nodelet shows how many votes you have remaining, out of your [id://5938|daily allotment].
It will also display your current [id://5938|experience points],
if you have gained or [id://168266|lost] any since your last page load.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Note that the XP nodelet is always displayed if you have votes
remaining or if there was an XP change. It cannot be turned off in your
[id://25185].

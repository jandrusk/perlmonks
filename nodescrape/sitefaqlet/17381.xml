2003-10-31 [theorbtwo] fixed time, minor HTML cleanup
2005-08-03 [jdporter] Title change from the unwieldy "When do I get my first votes? (or 'I just became a Novice, why can't I vote yet?')", in particular because of the semantic clash with a section within the Voting/Experience System node labeled "When do I get my votes?"
--&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;I just became a Novice; Why can't I vote yet?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you rise to the status of [id://17643], you will gain the ability to vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Votes are allocated once a day, at 00:25 (12:25 AM) server time (EST/EDT), 
so you may have to wait until the next day after attaining 
level 2 to get your first allotment of votes.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[id://5938] has info on how many votes you get at this and each succeeding level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr&gt;&lt;i&gt;Back to the [PerlMonks FAQ]&lt;/i&gt;</field>

This nodelet provides a way to add and view keywords on nodes.
&lt;!--
Soon you'll be able to search nodes by keywords, but I wouldn't hold my breath. 
--&gt;
The Keyword nodelet was [id://17794|introduced] in 2000, and there's still no
way to [id://490460|search], or do anything else useful, with keywords. Someday...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The Keyword nodelet displays the several most commonly added ("top") keywords.
It is o.k. to add a keyword again; in effect, this "votes" for the keyword.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
In the text box, you can type in one or more space-separated keywords. 
Keywords cannot contain spaces.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Janitors] have the ability to delete keywords from the list. For them, the Keywords
Nodelet includes checkboxes next to each keyword. To delete a keyword, check the 
corresponding checkbox and click 'Submit'.
&lt;/p&gt;

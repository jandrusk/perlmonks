&lt;!-- note: not techically OTHER users ... ALL users! --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This nodelet displays a list of all users who are currently active in the Monastery &amp;mdash; that is, those who have fetched a page (as a logged-in user) within the last three minutes. 
The list is not re-generated on every single hit, but is cached (for a short time). 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
These two factors combine to form a certain &lt;i&gt;staleness&lt;/i&gt; factor.
On one hand, the list may not show users who have &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; arrived &amp;mdash; including yourself!
On the other hand, the list may show users who were active several several minutes ago but are no longer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The list is sorted by [Voting/Experience System|Experience Points] (XP), with the more experienced monks on the top.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;small&gt;
There are ways to fetch login-requiring pages without getting onto the Other Users list.
How this works is explained in [id://72241].

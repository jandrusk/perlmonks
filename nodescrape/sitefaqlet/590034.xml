&lt;h1&gt;Patterns in PerlMonks Searches&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Neither search method supports any kind of patterns!
Do not be tempted to try a [id://172854|regex], or anything remotely like one.
Not even [id://361932|wildcards]!
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
No, all strings are interpreted as plain, simple strings.
Search/SuperSearch simply look for these strings occurring anywhere
in the title or body. (Search looks only in titles; SuperSearch looks
in titles or bodies, as you choose.)
No [id://505850|word boundaries] are inferred, either.
And all searching is [id://208289|case-insensitive].
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Note that, in SuperSearch, the default string separator is space,
but this can be changed. In Quick Search, this default cannot be
overridden.
&lt;/p&gt;

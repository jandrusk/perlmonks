The [Tutorials] page has two layers: the "top" layer is [id://954], which is a [superdoc]. It contains three components: the [id://510154] [doclist], the [id://465458], and the "Add a tutorial" form.
As a convenience, the "Edit" link in the top right corner of [954] actually takes you to the edit page for [510154].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
[SiteDocClan]: because [Tutorials] is a [doclist], with its own free-text field at the top, there is essentially no need for the  [Tutorials sitedoclet].  It should probably be left empty. (It would be rendered below the doclist anyway.)

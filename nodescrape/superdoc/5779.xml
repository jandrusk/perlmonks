&lt;h2&gt;Using the voting system&lt;/h2&gt;
An overly brief guide
&lt;p&gt;
To allow user to vote on a certain nodetype (or just a certain node)
you have to do a couple of things.  First make sure that the node's 
nodetype is listed in the "validTypes" field in [vote settings].  
Next, you must make a form (or include in a previously existing form)
the lines:&lt;P&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;INPUT TYPE="hidden" name="op" value="vote"&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This will make sure that the [vote] opcode is executed on the form
submission.  Next you include the htmlcode reference to the 
[voteit] function.  If you are using a metanode, you can use
"voteit:NODE_ID" and the option buttons will vote on the target node.

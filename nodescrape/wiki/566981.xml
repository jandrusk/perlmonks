New poll proposal:
&lt;c&gt;
I first became interested in Perl because...
The regular expressions
No need for explicit typing
I thought I needed to use it to make CGI scripts
all the modules on CPAN
it seemed trendy
it's very easy to pick up and start writing
my employer told me to
my friends convinced me to switch to it
&lt;/c&gt;

Bad cut'n'paste on that poll.  It contained soft hyphens and zero-width spaces (?).  One of the former showed up as an HTML correction for users with HTML nesting support turned on.  The strange spaces showed up as rectangles for those using some font/browser combinations.  I removed them all.

When a non-pollster feels compelled to replace your PRE block with a CODE block, then you've got a option in your poll that is way too long. (:

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2006-05-07 03:19:43]&lt;br /&gt;
A note regarding the "popularity" poll.  The first rule of [pollsters] is that we don't spoil our magic.  Let awe and wonder stand without explanation.  It's my belief that the current poll will achieve the best effect if we meet questions regarding it with silence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2006-05-07 03:11:59]&lt;br /&gt;
That's a pretty nice idea, but would require more code changes.
I'm going with what I had.  But it's definitely something to consider for
later.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[jacques]&lt;br /&gt;
You know what would be cool would be if the poll could show the top n users who were logged in (with the addition of paco). So the poll would be different as people come and go, but the only static choice would be paco who would get all the votes. Now that would be a cool hack. 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2006-05-04 23:01:54] &lt;br /&gt;
If the poll specifically takes the top n from the saints list nobody can and should complain.  If they do, they're killjoys.  I vote for running it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2006-05-04 19:29:10]&lt;br /&gt;
I explicitly don't want to pick and choose which monks are listed, since that in and of itself could cause irritation; I was hoping that people would recognize it as a list of the monks with the most XP (obviously excluding paco).  [merlyn] can defend himself, I'm sure.  I don't think talking about why [Abigail-II] left would be a bad thing (as opposed to talking about why [Abigail]-I left...).
&lt;p&gt;
If there is concern over these things, maybe just don't run the poll?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[jacques]&lt;br /&gt;
I like the gimmick choice, but I think the poll could invite people to give their opinion on some of those monks. Abigail and merlyn have been trashed before, so I don't know if that's a good thing. I am sure someone will bring up that Abigail isn't around anymore and then someone will ask why, etc, etc.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2006-05-02 19:26:20]&lt;br /&gt;
paco'd.  I knew people wouldn't be able to resist reading the wiki and spoiling their own fun.

Can we s/CowboyNeal/Paco/, please?  He's less of a real person and is a PerlMonks running gag instead of a slashdot(?) running gag.

&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2006-05-02 02:31:08]&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for getting around to working on the patch before me.  Good job.  I wonder if we shouldn't somehow obfuscate your proposal here in the wiki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

Sure, we can run it on the 31st or, if somebody comes up with something more suitable to start the year, we can delay it a bit more.

[ysth] has blessed [pollsters] with [test voting booth], and its accompanying [new testpoll].  [pollsters] can enable the [test voting booth] nodelet and use it for poll experimentation.  This will probably be mostly useful to [pmdev]/[pollsters] hybrid monks.  But any [pollsters|pollster] can post test polls.  Such polls will be visible only to [pollsters].  Feel free to test poll concepts there.

A poll with five options is fine.  I've toyed with the idea of posting a poll with only one option just to see how people react.  But I've held off, waiting for the perfect question for such a scenario.&lt;/p&gt;

Notice at the top of this page a new entry under "Useful links": [id://505949|Pollsters' Protocols].  This is a FAQlet specifically for [pollsters].  It's a work in progress, so I would appreciate any suggestions, corrections, points of order, rants, raves.  Highly vocal critics will become the subject of a future poll though.  (just kidding)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], [localtime://2005-11-02 07:25:00]&lt;br /&gt;
You are quite right about the role of humor in this sort of thing.  However you're also right 
about the role of time. 300 years later, I certainly hope people would be able to laugh about
things.  However I'm not sure I'm not sure I would approach a bunch of people who'd been 
forcibly baptized &lt;em&gt;yesterday&lt;/em&gt;, and say, "Hey, you think those soldiers were bad? 
You should have seen the nuns who taught CCD back home!"  Sure, &lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt; think it's 
funny...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And, I'm somewhat discouraged to say, the events which provoked the recent, minor displays of
outrage happened &lt;em&gt;half a millenium&lt;/em&gt; ago.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Still, so far, so good, and I hope it remains that way.  If I'm shown to be a nervous nancy in 
this, I'll admit it with good cheer.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2005-11-02 14:58:34]&lt;br /&gt;
I actually was hoping to let people let off a little steam innocuously, hence the negative focus of the question.  I thought asking what &lt;em&gt;would&lt;/em&gt; be a good level title might explode in acrimony.  So far it seems to have worked...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2005-11-02 14:06:15]&lt;br /&gt;
[ysth] and I considered and discussed this before letting the poll go live.  We discussed allowing Grand Inquisitor to appear, but decided that in the context of (1)A humorous poll, and (2)voting for the least appropriate, it would not ruffle feathers.  I'm particularly sensitive to not having a repeat of a previous situation that I was involved in with a poll that I accidentally worded convroversially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But polls &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; more interesting if they are somehow relevant to current events, and to that end, the recent overhaul (major news) is excellent fodder, and within reason, fair game, IMHO.  We did toss out at least one other option that I decided had a socially negative feeling in modern day.  But the inquisiton was a 'hellofa long time ago'.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was recently in the Philippines on vacation.  The Filipinos were overrun by the Spanish for about 300 years, starting when Magellan showed up in Cebu and started "converting" all those asians to Catholicism.  I'm sure it wasn't pleasant for those of them who didn't feel a strong personal desire to convert.  But now, hundreds of years later, it's the fodder of a light hearted Filipino folk song where they laugh and sing about the day that "Magellan showed up and baptised us all."
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, take heart, [petruchio]; [ysth] and [davido|I] aren't trying to antagonize you or the monastery.  If anything a light-hearted poll should help to diffuse the situation by reminding everyone that this is just for fun anyway, and we may as well joke about it.  It's human nature to calm our nerves with a little laughter.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Petruchio], [localtime://2005-11-02 09:22:00]&lt;br /&gt;
Given the emotional nature of the discussions surrounding the historical
Grand Inquistiors, I must admit that I was rather hoping to see the topic
become less popular soon.  I'm not sure prompting for further discussion
is altogether prudent.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
For that matter, a minority of people are sincerely unhappy with the changes, 
and several of the poll options were ones they've actually suggested as improvements. 
This poll seems designed to keep the complaints coming, and keep attention 
focused on what was inevitably to be a fractious process.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Is there a reason to be focusing on the negative generally?
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Update:  I don't man this to sound overly harsh.  Possibly I'm overstating

the significance of this... so far the comments have been innocuous.  I just 
have this vision of [Tanktalus] posting Ode to Torquemada, in which he uses
heroic couplets to thank him for inventing the hot air balloon, whereupon 
the heads several Perlmonk Jews in Exile promptly explode.

Point taken regarding "most", thanks. As for the ridiculous option, it wouldn't hurt me if it were an "entirely serious poll" (for some definitions of serious)... I don't think anything bad would come from that... However, if more of you second [ysth]'s idea, I will definitely add one or two ridiculous options :-) (even [Paco], perhaps)

Thanks for your weigh-in [ysth].  I would assert that there should be no content changes.  Fixing a typo to improve readability, or fixing formatting should probably be the extent of the editing that ever takes place. Words should not be changed (even if they were used in poor judgement).  Better to learn from mistakes and/or start a new one in 24 hours than to alter content.  Certanly nothing should be done that would affect the poll's outcome.  Despite them not being a scientific tool, they should still be handled with care.  Oh, and for the record, no adding options after the fact either. ;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I get back in town I'll work on a [pollsters] faqlet with information derived from this wiki and actual experience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[ysth], [localtime://2005-09-13 12:59:42]&lt;br /&gt;
[pollsters] can edit polls; just use ";displaytype=edit".  If there are drastic changes, the voting should be restarted, which for now requires godly intervention,
but go ahead and just do minor formatting &amp; typo correction.  I added the em tags.
Older polls should probably never be edited, though.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2005-09-13 02:45:04] &lt;br /&gt;
Would there be any value in making polls editable?  Or would that present a risk of tainting the scientifically gathered data? (tongue in cheek)  In the current poll, for example, I forgot to use &lt;c&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/c&gt; tags around &lt;em&gt;Just another Perl hacker,&lt;/em&gt;.  It would be nice to be able to touch up after the fact (or at least preview?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, just a final reminder; I'll be AFK from Sept 14th through Sept 30th.  If the poll is to be rotated, someone else will need to do the honors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

Why remove the antivroom reference?  Looks ok to me.
I'd make it "[gods]' swimmming pool" and "&lt;strike&gt;a better&lt;/strike&gt; the ultimate"
though.

&lt;li&gt;I'd buy the house next door to Bill and blast the Windows startup theme music every time I have to reboot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I'd finally get rid of my Pentium-II.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I would fund a research project into building a &lt;strike&gt;better&lt;/strike&gt; ultimate mousetrap.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2005-09-10 11:58:14] &lt;br /&gt;
I want to be quite honest here [tye].  When the controversy over the outsourcing poll began to build I also fell quite ill with a bronchial infection and fever.  The depth of my illness occurred about the same time that I chose to replace the poll to eliminate the controversy.  My goal was only to eliminate controversy, not create a new one.  When I looked up the word, in my state, I missed the meaning.  It was another blunder, but not intentional, and all I can say is that I felt a hasty need to make the change, and in my condition, chose the wrong word.  It wasn't until yesterday that I realied what I had done. A better choice would have been holy.  It really was a mistake.  On the bright side, I'm recovering now that I'm on antibiotics.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], [localtime://2005-09-10 03:43:09]&lt;br /&gt;
(I'm over being upset about it.)  FYI, I looked up santimonious in the dictionary when I saw it to make sure there wasn't some innocent meaning that I wasn't aware of.  What I found was:
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;
excessively or hypocritically pious
Synonym: holier-than-thou
&lt;/blockquote&gt;(the best match to what I thought it meant),&lt;blockquote&gt;
hypocritical, ..., phony, two-faced. See dishonest
&lt;/blockquote&gt;and&lt;blockquote&gt;
Feigning piety or righteousness: &amp;#8220;a solemn, unsmiling, sanctimonious old iceberg that looked like he was waiting for a vacancy in the Trinity&amp;#8221; (Mark Twain).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Which matched my understanding of the word, i.e., that is only a harsh insult (a word that is likely to be followed by "bastard").
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
So that explains some of my negative reaction.  But it's water under the bridge for me.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2005-09-09 00:53:14] &lt;br /&gt;
I dove into the polls idea quest for that poll, and it had a positive rep.  I didn't intend for it to offend, and honestly misjudged how it would be seen.  I have apologized to several in its regard, and have thought a lot about it.  It was a blunder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I realized early on that it was causing a controversy, I asked in the CB if I should change it.  I believe I was told no, but after 12 hours or so, I felt that though its rep was positive it was upsetting some people to the point that it ought to be removed ASAP.  This place should be fun at nobody's expense.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In reading the responses to that poll (yes, I read them all, they do matter to me) I saw that  someone ([demerphq]) suggested we stick to more traditional controversies such as emacs vs vi.  It seemed like a good suggestion, and it was with good intentions that I picked at random a few such topics that we see debated once in awhile, and I made up a few silly ones.  My choice of the word sanctimonious was not intended to cause offense.  I even double checked it in the dictionary before using it, to make sure there was no double-meaning or negative connotiation.  I intended it as a juxtaposition of concepts: hotly debated topics, versus the serinity of a sanctimonious monastery... a sort of oxymoron.  That's it, really.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm sorry for picking a poll from the ideas quest that was insensitive.  I apologize that what replaced it didn't come across with the smirk that I had as I typed it.  But more importantly, I am sorry if it caused further injury.  That was never my intent.  Lessons learned?  Be cautious, be sensitive, and strictly adhere to posting poll proposals 24 hours before they go live.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good thing I'm going on vacation in a few days.  Someone else take a turn with the next poll. ;)  I'll be back for more punishment in October, and maybe the beaches and sun will reset my internal barometer.  Till then, thanks for all the hard work, input and patience.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[tye&amp;nbsp;], [localtime://2005-09-08 13:18:35]&lt;br /&gt;
I've deleted a rather scathing rant about the single-handed use of privilege to apply the label "our sanctimonious Monastery" in response to being rather mildly and well-manneredly criticized for being insensitive.  I realize that I'm in a tiny minority (perhaps a minority of one) in having this reaction.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I really don't want to have a big cleansing discussion about motivations anymore.  I don't really want to see a public apology (as it would just result in the prior item).  I'd rather just sweep the whole mess under the rug and forget it happened and be relatively sure it doesn't happen again.  I'd rather not replace the current poll in a hurry.  Heck, it has a positive rep.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You can't please all the people all the time, and sometimes you really piss someone off.  I'll get over it, especially if it just quietly disappears.  In any case, I think I'll actively try to ignore it for a while.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
I apologize for not coming up with even less scathing, less rantish comment.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And I sincerely thank [ysth] for making [pollsters] and thank the [pollsters] for doing the work to make polls happen.  And I especially thank [davido] for taking a prominent role in the process.  Keep up the good work, even when I occasionally personally find myself reluctant to call it "good".

[pollsters] have taken sufficient heat from the recent poll.  I guess I shouldn't have been so hasty to get it going.  Anyway, rather than try to explain why I didn't think it would be a problem, I'll just propose a replacement now, and will activate it shortly.  We shall take this as a lesson; err on the side of caution.  ...this one should be unoffensive enough:

[cog]: The voting on your most recent poll has been decent; 23 upvotes, no significant downvotes, and over 250 opinion votes in a week's time.  There is the possibility that people won't notice that this is a new poll since there is  only a slight change in its wording.  If you're skeptical, we might dive back into the [poll ideas quest] for different idea.  It won't hurt anything if it takes another few days to get it right.  But if you want to post the already queued poll, I don't really see a significant problem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

I think the "All the choices are retarded. I'm not voting on this one." comment was itself meant to be a humorous quip.  As for making it clear that they're for fun, it's in the FAQ: [id://324077]: "&lt;em&gt;It must be stressed that the polling booth is for amusement only, and should not be taken seriously.&lt;/em&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strike&gt;I do notice that under the Nodelet category in the [id://237040] there is no entry for polls.  Since I'm [SiteDocClan] too, I'll write a FAQlet and propose that it get added to the FAQ list page.&lt;/strike&gt; Woops, it's there, I'm just blind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;i&gt;Remember, Monastery polls are just for fun. We're not doing political surveys, evaluating consumer preferences, or any other kind of scientific study. An occasional 'interesting' poll is ok as long as it doesn't attempt to be too serious. In general, keep the polls light-hearted. Avoid subjects that might draw out flame wars.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I added a link to the top of this page to [past polls], which lists all the polls (including the current one) and the date they were created.

&lt;p&gt;[davido], [localtime://2005-07-27 13:11:03]&lt;br /&gt;
New entries to the wiki always go at the top, even if they're followups.  Dissimilar topics should be separated by an &amp;lt;hr /&amp;gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nothing is ever removed from a wiki.  This will be our prepetual record of past polls, to prevent duplication.  When the wiki gets rotated we'll have to ask that the new wiki link to the previous, and so on, like a chain of history.  That means, when a poll gets posted, all we do is update the wiki to show the post date.  But we don't remove anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polls can be posted anytime, but favoring weekdays is fine.  The idea is to keep it fresh.  Please post the poll queue item to the wiki a day or so in advance so that we don't step on each other.  Unless there's protest amongst [pollsters], we'll assume that the next poll in the wiki's queue will be the next one to go up.  To keep this simple, let's keep the queue to three polls or less for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't want to say post only on weekdays because that would eliminate weekends, and there may be times where a weekend-posted poll is the right thing to do.  But it's certanly ok to favor weekdays.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, the person posting the poll to the wiki queue will be the one to submit it in the new poll form.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think a list of poll dates is too structured.  Approximately one-week timing is pretty good, but there will be times when we want one sooner, and times where a poll may live longer than a week.  There may even be a current event type poll that will jump forward in the queue and bypass the wiki proposal, though those should be few and far between, and they should still be listed in the wiki as they're submitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Play it by ear.  Too many rules will make it unwieldy.  Jump in and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;

[cog] says Hi :-) I was waiting for somone to post a first idea on the Wiki to see if I understood how it would work. I assume new ideas will be placed on top of the Wiki, as everything has been so far. I also assume the person posting the poll will submit it. And I assume the person doing that will also remove the poll from the Wiki. Am I right so far? Another thing, can we have a list of dates for poll releases? :-) It would be nice. It would also be nice if we could release them during the week. For several reasons :-) Sorry for the long messages O:-)

Please welcome [cog] to [pollsters].

&lt;h2&gt;Using the [new poll] form&lt;/h2&gt;
Create polls by clicking [new poll].  Fill in the poll's title.  Answers should be listed one per line in the multi-line textbox.  Poll response options may contain monastery-style HTML.  Don't worry about any special poll encoding.  Radio buttons and forms are all set up automatically by the poll mechanism.  Just put one response option per line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By default the person posting the poll will be credited as the author.  You may select another individual (in case the poll was submitted to [pollsters] by someone else), or you can specify [pollsters] (the group) as the author (use this feature sparingly).  

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Poll scheduling and wiki tracking&lt;/h2&gt;
New polls should be posted at approximately one-week intervals.  This is a higher frequency than we had prior to the existance of [pollsters] as a [Cabal] group, but will serve to keep the polls fresh.  If there's time, post the anticipated title and release date to the wiki about a day or more before creating the poll. This will help in the future as [pollsters] grows so that we're not stepping on each others' polls.  It will also facilitate comments and discussion in advance of the poll going live.  Let's try to keep the queue down to no more than two or three pending polls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use this format:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;Poll title&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Contributed by: (if applicable)&lt;br /&gt;
Proposed release date: mm/dd/yyyy&lt;br /&gt;
Released: mm/dd/yyyy as &lt;code&gt;[id://poll's node id]&lt;/code&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That way we can easily keep track of how old polls are, what's coming next, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, Monastery polls are just for fun.  We're not doing political surveys, evaluating consumer preferences, or any other kind of scientific study.  An occasional 'interesting' poll is ok as long as it doesn't attempt to be too serious.  In general, keep the polls light-hearted.  Avoid subjects that might draw out flame wars.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye], 2002-08-23&lt;br /&gt;
I removed the "writeup mover" from "editors nodelet" because moving approved nodes doesn't work right.  If you want to move an approved node, then use the editors' nodelet to unapprove it and then use the approval nodelet to move it. This is a quick hack. The approval implementation is going to change soon (see [ar0n]) and that should also make this work better.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kudra&lt;/strong&gt; same day&lt;br /&gt;
I was doing that before I went on vacation, and things seemed
really bad then...I came back and everything was clean. I guess
everyone was just happy to have me gone &lt;tt&gt;;)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;[footpad], ~Fri Aug 16 15:28:32 2002 (GMT)&lt;BR /&gt;
I think it's a combination of the pleas and the fact that a few of us are providing feedback to those who consider poorly.  (I know [tye]'s sent a few notes, as have I.)  Also, I've personally tried to stay on top of things a little more aggressively than I was doing (remember, I don't have much of an RL anymore) and I've noticed that others are, too.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kudra&lt;/strong&gt; 16 Aug, 2002&lt;br /&gt;
I've noticed far fewer bad considerations lately.  Am I missing the
considerations?  Have people listened to our pleas?  Or has some 
code been added to handle this?  Just curious, although I really 
appreciate the lean new nre.
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

It doesn't feel like a tutorial to me. More like an extended word-to-the-wise. This thread forces me to think through what I think a tutorial is. I agree that sample code is a common feature of many good tutorials. But for me, two key distinguishing features are the "walk-through" character of most tutorials and the intended audience: people ready to learn some new skill for which there is a significant learning curve. This post is more of a check-list of good practices... It doesn't walk me through learning a new skill. It coaches me in honing my present skills. Good post though. I was glad to ++ it.

It is a good meditation, but I don't think it qualifies as a tutorial.  I hate to say that, but tutorials (IMHO) should walk people through some examples and this doesn't.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[dws] 14 Aug 2002&lt;br/&gt;
Not all tutorials need code. I say keep it in [Tutorials].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;[footpad], ~Wed Aug 14 22:35:27 2002 (GMT)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;P&gt;I need a judgment call, folks.  While [id://187935|this] is an excellent Meditation, I'm not sure it's suitable for [Tutorials].  Mainly because there's no code.  Your thoughts?&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kudra, 01 August 2002&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It's a wiki--if you don't like it, edit it :P
Seriously, I just think it looks silly to highlight names so I don't do it.
I've put this in bold to make it stand out.  If that still bothers you
I'll try to remember to highlight my name in the wiki if you promise to
never highlight my name in the chatterbox ;)
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[tye], 2002-07-30&lt;br /&gt;
I'd like to make posting to Q+A a level power.  I'd rather a good FAQish discussion be turned into a Q+A not by moving it but by restating the question very carefully and providing the best of the answers.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Those [editors] who want to help with Q+A are free to petition for membership in Q+A Editors.  Or we could just make all of [editors] a member (the distinction is mostly just historical, I think).
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
And I like the extra highlighting provided by brackets around names at the tops of wiki entries.  Don't be so modest, [kudra]. (:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kudra, 30 July 2002&lt;br /&gt;
Personally, I'd rather see it made impossible to post to Q&amp;amp;A
and instead allow Q&amp;amp;A editors to move posts to that section.
Some means of drawing an editor's attention to suitable nodes
(consideration, for example, but Q&amp;amp;A editors would have to
be able to unconsider then).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[dws] 30 July 2002&lt;br/&gt;
IMHO, it should be possible for an editor to move a new post (say, one that hasn't garnered any responses yet) out of Q&amp;amp;A and into SoPW without having to hunt down someone to make that move. The situation isn't any different from errant posting appearing in Meditations or Poetry. We should be able to do a quick cleanup.
&lt;p&gt;
Fellow editors, your thoughts on this?

&lt;p&gt;kudra, 30 July 2002&lt;br /&gt;
You contact the Q&amp;amp;A editor in charge of that section (editors
can't manipulate Q&amp;amp;A, only Q&amp;amp;A editors--a different group--can).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[dws] 29 July 2002&lt;br/&gt;
What's the trick (or is there one) for moving a post out of [Categorized Questions and Answers] and into, say, [Seekers of Perl Wisdom]?
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kudra, 22 July 2002&lt;br /&gt;
I am against footpad's proposal of not allowing consideration until
after voting, for reasons explained in person.  The short version is
that I don't like votes tied to deletion to begin with--I find it anything
but constructive for people to be required to downvote newbies who have
accidently double-posted.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[chromatic] 11 July 2002&lt;br /&gt;
Or remove auto-reaping... I have misgivings about the idea, however.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;[footpad], 2002 July 11: What if one could not Consider a node until after they've voted on it?  Would that cut down on the inappropriate considerations?  

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;P&gt;[footpad], 2002 July 10: I ended up posting it because the issue came up in the Chatterbox.  Sigh.  Another well laid plan up-ended by end-users.  ;-)&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye], 2002-07-10&lt;br /&gt;
I think it starts out too soft / vague.  I'd like to see "no effort" and "not perl" mentioned explicitly very early.  I'll try to look in more detail soon.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[footpad] 2002 July 10&lt;br /&gt;

I think a number of us are feeling that Consideration is out of hand and I thought it would be good to provide a coordinated assault on the problem.  I've privately /msg'd a few of you to hold on posting rants until I had some time to finish some thoughts I'd been compasing on the subject since [tye] called me on the obscuration thing.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;To that end, I've prepared an inital [pad://footpad|draft of a PMD] on the subject.  I'd like your (/msg'd) feedback on it before posting it publically.  Suggestions, comments, and other thoughts would be greatly appreciated.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;You don't have to agree with me, of course (that'd make a good reply), but I thought it might help to publically discuss some of these ideas and do have at least a plan while doing so.  &lt;I&gt;--f&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[chromatic] Tue Jul  9 00:34:30 UTC 2002&lt;br /&gt;
I've added a short patch for the [Approval Nodelet] to disallow the two lamest consideration reasons.  I didn't apply it because it's somewhat lame and it's still worth discussing.  I'm preparing a lecturing meditation.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[tye], 2002-07-07&lt;br /&gt;
I think the missing previous discussion on reparenting some nodes so some blank nodes could be nuked was via private /msgs, not the [wiki].
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The "no effort" and "not perl" considerations are still out of control and probably getting worse.  I think we need an "off topic" type of consideration to allow people to "vent" as my other attempts have failed. (: We might also want to let [editors] vote to unreap nodes...  But features take time and peoplel to write them...  Feel free to yell at people in the mean time. :)
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Just a quick note.  Later.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[chromatic] 06 July 2002&lt;br /&gt;
I'm somewhat less than pleased with the reaping of [id://179904].  As it turns out, it was indeed Perl related.  I feel a lecturing meditation coming on, but will wait for input from other editors before making a decision either way.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;kudra, 2002-07-07&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps the content you're looking for is in one of the wiki logs?
There's a discussion that
touches on these subjects in [id://96695|wiki through 2001-07-14].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[tye], 2002-07-05&lt;br /&gt;
I've never liked helping people purge their own nodes (except for usual clear reasons for reaping nodes).  I've always been against reaping blank nodes or nodes marked as the author wanting it to be deleted &lt;b&gt;when it has a reply&lt;/b&gt;.  I'm more convinced of that now.  If I see a blanked-out node or author-requested deletion that has a reply, I will vote "keep" and I won't unconsider it.  If I see a reply to such a node marked as "reparent", I will vote "keep" and I won't move it.  We should not be helping people rewrite history.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
[Olecram] has a lot of options open and needs to adapt in a more useful manner (post anonymously, get a new ID and don't use it to yell at people in the chatterbox, grow up and stop yelling at people, just ask questions here and go elsewhere to yell at people, etc.).  If "blanking" the node doesn't get it reaped (when it has replies), then [Olecram] will have to pick a new tactic.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
This came up before but appears to have been purged from the wiki (I'm curious why).  Let us not get carried away with the ability to rewrite history.  Let us restrict our actions to being janitors and cleaning up messes made by technical goofs, not cleaning up peoples' words that they regret.  Down that path lies madness (and people not thinking before they post cause they know that they can just blank it out and we'll make it appear as if they'd never said anything).  If someone posts a node and then regrets it, then they can replace the node with a notice/apology.  We need to encourage that over trying to reap the node.
&lt;!-- &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Also, the [gods] have better tools now and so it is easy for us to see what downvoting is going on.  I have a simple fix for much of this "problem" but I need a big chunk of time to compose the description of it as (so far) most have reacted to it negatively &lt;b&gt;at first&lt;/b&gt;.  I'm continuing to become more convinced of the need/benefit of this.  I doubt any site change will turn [Olecram] into an ideal member, but it might reduce both the amount of downvoting against [Olecram] and [Olecram]'s reaction to it such that [Olecram] would no longer feel the need for such drastic avoidance techniques. --&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[neophyte] Thu Jul 7 2002&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sorry I have to bring this up here, but [Olecram]s attitude will perhaps give us more trouble. Today he asked several of his nodes to be deleted. 
I saw that he had deleted the contents of several node with apparently not to bad content, because he wants them to go away. He's talking about personality voting, and said what he'll do in the future is post and delete as soon as he's got an answer. &lt;br&gt; This is obviously not what the site is for, apart from making a lot of work.&lt;br&gt;While I did consider a parent node of his, I also voted to keep it, because it contained a valid question.&lt;br&gt;
What else can we do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 [Petruchio] Wed Jun 26 16:55:50 UTC 2002
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Well, the DeCSS code was a different issue.  A similar one, in some ways, but
 different from, in particular, a legal standpoint. Though I know that node went
 away, I'm still unclear as to how, or whose decision it was. No policy statement
 that I can recall was ever articulated on the topic; this, I think, should change.
 I would also like to see a policy decision (publically) made which covers cases
 like port scanners. Whatever that decision might be, I'm sure we'll all abide it.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Though I use the word 'never', my statement is not wholly unqualified. I do specify
 the opinions of a &lt;i&gt;few&lt;/i&gt; editors... not a quorum, or even a lot. For that reason,
 I think my statement reasonable; and I think three is just too few in such a case.
 This is why I do not feel compelled to say 'almost'.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Editorial deletion is a great, almost unchecked power, and the fact that it has
 caused so little strife until now is to the credit of our editors. I feel that in
 this case it went awry, however, and I regretted my inability to cast an editorial
 keep vote, or (short of going deus ex machina to the database, which I am always
 loathe to do, and for which there was little time) to pause the process for discussion.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 The present case disturbed me less than the sudden apprehension that we did not
 share the same underlying principles on editing; I'm glad that, on everything
 I feel is important, we agree, [footpad]. Not to say that my principles are the
 best ones, but a general consensus makes life far easier where the social structure
 is not rigid. If you over-reacted... then you did as we all do from time to time.
 Such is life.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;[footpad], ~Wed Jun 26 13:44:54 2002 (GMT)&lt;BR /&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Hm.  I can't disagree with that (I may have been a bit grouchy myself).  If I over-reacted, I apologize.  As I recall, though, that the DeCSS node from some time back was also getting upvoted.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;I will disagree with your use of the word never.  Unless you add an "almost" in front of it.  :-)  &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;I&gt;--f&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
 [Petruchio] Wed Jun 26 06:23:03 UTC 2002
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I was wondering, and was distressed that I did not immediately see who commented
 out the code.  I'm glad you told us here.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 I do not agree with reaping this node.  As you point out, it was being upvoted.
 It presently has seven keep votes to eight delete votes.  It seems that there is
 no consensus on the validity or value of such code on this site.  This calls into
 serious question the decision to actively attempt to get it reaped... it's &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt;
 a blank node. It's a piece of network code, which has been made to look like a blank
 node to those who are voting on its consideration.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Port scanners are tools.  I use them, and I am not a cracker. I am not the person
 to declare that such things should be allowed here, certainly, but I do think
 it's a matter for discussion, not editorial fiat.  The quality of the code or
 the formatting should, in my opinion, be no more an issue for this program than
 for others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
 Since I began writing this, things have changed.  I first got a Tough Beans error
 when attempting to read the node; highly unusual, my being a god and all. And now
 this, too, has changed; the node is not found.  It looks like we've been very hasty
 here; if the node was nuked by editorial deletion, it's a sad thing. Fast track
 deletion should &lt;i&gt;never&lt;/i&gt; be used to override public opinion in favor of the
 opinions of a few editors.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;[footpad], 2002.06.25&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;P&gt;In case anyone's wondering, I commented out the content of [id://177144|PlScan] in an attempt to get it reaped.  It was being voted up and I don't think we need to encourage the kiddies.  Besides, I'm sure [merlyn] has a column on the topic.  ;-)&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Note, In doing so, I discovered an interesting side effect.  By changing the title to &amp;lt;!-- PLScan --&amp;gt;, it made the node appear as if it had been reaped when using &amp;#091;id://177144&amp;#093; to link to it in the wiki.  I had to add a title to make the link accessible.  Curious, eh?  This may be an interesting trick we can use to hide certain nodes during the Consideration process.  &lt;I&gt;--f&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye], 2002-06-22&lt;br /&gt;
We're starting to see some of the features for the shared message inbox getting implemented.  So, it ain't great yet but ppl can, right now, do "/msg editors something" and it will show up in the "editors shared message inbox", see the "smi" link in the editors' nodelet.  Note that you can't delete are archive these messages yet (nor edit them) and there is no indication that messages are waiting.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[footpad], ~Fri Jun 21 15:29:15 2002 (GMT)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I suppose that depends on how retentive we want to be about keeping duplicate nodes.  If we want to get rid of them, then I think hiding the content will help keep the scan voters from preventing their reaping.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[chromatic], 20 June 2002&lt;br /&gt;
Is it really a problem if a duplicate node gets upvotes?  I realize that that means it can't be reaped, but is that sufficiently bad to go to the work required to hide them?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;P&gt;[footpad], 2002-06-20&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;P&gt;While we're on the subject of the editorial experience, would folks mind hiding the content of duplicate nodes?  It seems many of the average monks are blindly voting up nodes in threads, without paying any attention to the titles that are clearly labelled DUPLICATE.  Thus, some true duplicates are remaining because they keep collecting ++'s.  (Speaking of which, would someone mind casting the third (and final) editorial delete on [id://176000|this]?)&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[kudra], 2002-06-18&lt;br /&gt;
I've recently made quite a few suggestions for changing the editorial
experience (thanks for implementing some of the suggestions :).  Lately
I've been wondering if adding more automated messages to send is the
way to go about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rather than all the disjointed messages to people, and notes at
the bottom of nodes, perhaps a log of actions taken for a node (approval,
moving to a new section, reparenting, editing, consideration, unconsideration,
and so on) would be useful.  Everything could be automatically logged,
with an option for the person to provide an explanation. Logging could
of course optionally also send messages as well.  I'd suggest
that by default edits to the node be displayed below the node (much like
our current paste-ins), with the complete log a click away. 
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I think this is probably a fair amount of work and not likely to happen
soon, but it has some advantages.  First, it means the burden of remembering
what was done to a node doesn't fall upon the people who did it.  It would
also serve the function of reducing the fears of those who worry editors
have no accountability.  I think a fair amount of information that would
go in the log is already stored in various ways in the database; this
would group related information together.
&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[footpad], 2002-06-16&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;P&gt;Recently, I posted a node that mentioned some restructuring I'm planning on doing to [Tutorials].  [kudra], goddess that she is, suggested I drop a note here outlining those changes, just in case anyone else got tired of waiting for me to do this.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Basically, I'm planning on adding a TOC (with named  HREF's) to the tutorial sections, reorganizing things to more clearly illustrate the categories, and will also add an "Other Tutorials" section that contains links to nodes that are (arguably) off topic.  The "RTFM" tutorials come to mind, as does [tachyon]'s recent post.  I had hoped to do this over the weekend, but I'm not sure that's going to happen.  (Sorry, but I still need to do some RL-related stuff today.)&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;In the mean time, please leave the [Tutorials] currently in NTC for me to incorporate into this work.  I'll try to get it finished in the next few days.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;Thoughts and suggestions would be appreciated.  I will be posting a preview in my [pad://footpad|pad] beforehand.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;--f&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;HR /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye], 2002-06-11&lt;br /&gt;
Both self-approval and self-frontpaging have been disallowed.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;P&gt;[neophyte], 11 June 2002&lt;BR /&gt;
I'd prefer disallowing both, self-approving and self-frontpaging, with a priority for disallowing the latter.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;[footpad], 10 June 2002&lt;BR /&gt;
I can see a case for letting authors approve their own nodes (after all, we're still seeing a lot of unapproved nodes get replies).  I do agree that someone else should front-page an author's node.  What I would like to see is entries in the Approval nodelet along the lines of "Approval removed by..." and "Removed from front-page by..."&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;To keep it simple, I'd a) just track the last set of actions and b) reset the appropriate flag when the reverse action is taken.  For example, suppose x FP's a node and I withdraw that approval.  Later, Y sees what I did and decides that I was overly harsh and puts it back on the Gates.  At that point, I wouldn't expect to see any record of my earlier action.&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[corion], 2002-06-10&lt;br /&gt;
I'm also for disallowing approving/frontpaging your own nodes - it protects you from being stupid. Of course my node is approvable and front-page-worthy, as I've taken the time to write it, but that judgement should be left to others - it's the same as the order that "people should mark their mail as important if I should read them" - this will only result in all mails being marked &lt;tt&gt;:-))&lt;/tt&gt;. On the other side, why protect people - let them get burned ... &lt;tt&gt;:-)&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;i&gt;PS: Has anybody talked to the author ?&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[tye], 2002-06-10&lt;br /&gt;
I'll add that I've seen bright, high-level monks approve their own nodes and then regret it.  It is easy to develop a blind spot on the problem you are having and that can lead you to believe that you've asked a great question when you haven't.  If there is some time-critical reason to get a question approved (not that I can come up with such), then you can just ask.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[chromatic], 10 June 2002&lt;br /&gt;
I'd prefer someone besides the author making that decision.  Disabling the checkboxes is fine with me.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[mirod], 2002-06-10&lt;br /&gt;
I'd remove both check boxes, allowing one to approve/FP their posts effectively removes what little control the site offers on posts by monks level 5 and above. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[tye], 2002-06-10&lt;br /&gt;
I have no problem with making both the "Approve" and "Frontpage" check boxes disabled for your own nodes.  But when I said this, I got flack from several people about using a heavy hand (even if only "Frontpage" was disabled).  I still don't see much point in allowing self-approval, but I bow to the will of others.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Ovid], 2002-06-10&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Stegalex] has [id://172946|front-paged his own post].  I know we've discussed this before, but does anyone object to the idea of automatically removing "self front-page approvals"?  I don't really care if someone approves their own post (I've been known to do it), but if everyone were to start front-paging their own posts then the Gates will start to be a duplicate of Newest Nodes and thus virtually useless.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;k, 2002-06-11&lt;br /&gt;
A counter of total nodes on nre would be a very small change and useful.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kudra, 2002-06-08&lt;br /&gt;
Another suggestion while I'm at it...
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Checkboxes to append to messages&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When I edit a node and message the author, I generally state what
I changed in the node.  It might also be nice to have a series of
checkboxes with common problems (bad titles, not using code tags, and
so on) which, if checked, would append to the message sent to
the author something like:
&lt;em&gt;You might want to read about READMORE tags for
future reference.&lt;/em&gt;  The reasons could be joined--for example, if
someone need a new title and a readmore tag, it might say:
&lt;em&gt;You might want to read about selecting a good title and READMORE
tags for future reference.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I've compiled a list of nodes these could be linked to, but most of
the nodes would require some modification from the site doc clan to
be suitable for this.  Side note: the information nodelet should be
cleaned up to point to only the most recent documents.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post needed a READMORE tag: [id://32726|32726].&lt;br /&gt;
    This is just an introduction on the tag; I would suggest
    the readmore tag be added to standard documentation instead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post had to be moved: [id://9953|9953#wheredoipost] or
    [id://42273|42273] or [id://972|972]&lt;br /&gt;
    9953 says more up-to-date information is available 
    [id://17316|here], but the new documentation doesn't address this
    topic, and it is the old documentation that is linked at the
    bottom of nodes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post required code tags, or had brackets interpreted as links:
    [id://9953|9953#code]&lt;br /&gt;
    This is from the same document as the last point and has the same
    problem.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post was poorly formatted: [id://17558|17558]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;post required a new title: No document specifically addresses this.
    The recent [id://172086|172086#title] does have a section on it, but in
    my opinion it would be better to put this information in a
    site doc, and remove actual examples, sticking with pseudo
    examples intead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
On a side note, it doesn't seem possible to make a link like
&amp;#091;id://172086#title|some node&amp;#093;.  If that won't be changing,
it would probably be better to split up these documents in to smaller
pieces so we can link directly to the relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It might
also be useful to be able to alias nodes, so that entering a number
related to an out-of-date doc would in fact take you to the document
registered as the newer version.  That would certainly look better than
having all those &lt;em&gt;This document is out of date, read here...&lt;/em&gt;
links at the top of pages.
&lt;/p&gt;

Hard work?  Methinks you're teasing me a bit, seeing as the only work
I did was ask someone else to do lots of it &lt;tt&gt;:)&lt;/tt&gt;.  I certainly
wouldn't mind read access to pmdev wiki, especially if there's any

info there about plans.  (As you know, [id://171961|I like to know about plans].
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[tye], 2002-06-07&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for the hard work, [kudra].  You forgot "edit" links to each node directly from [Nodes to Consider].  Those all make sense.  Perhaps we need to give [editors] read-only access to [pmdev wiki] and [pmdev] read-only access to the [editors] wiki?  To save me time, I'll just cut'n'paste your comments into [pmdev] wiki in hopes of getting someone to start working on these things.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;kudra, 2002-06-06&lt;br /&gt;
I was recently making a number of suggestions to ar0n, and it got to the
point that he recommended I make a list here to get other opinions (and
probably to save himself some msgs).  This is not to say that I'm not
happy with the improvements to editor tools, such as ehomat and the 'edit'
link in nre, but I still find myself repeating a lot of the same tasks
several times daily and I think there's room for more automation, especially
as the nodes that require editor assistance continue to increase.
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;An editor's version of ntc&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Right now, you have to click on a node in order to give it an editorial
delete vote, or to unconsider it (assuming it doesn't have enough edit
votes to show up in nre).  I would like to see editorial delete and
unconsider options that can be applied to a number of nodes at one
time, much like the current ntc options.  The delete would be useful 
for large numbers of blank nodes (there were at least 5 in ntc today), 
whereas the unconsider could be used for nodes which have too many
keep votes to be deleted.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Automatic messaging box for unconsidered nodes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have recently started msging people when I unconsider their nodes
due to a large number of keep votes.  The message is generally:
&lt;em&gt;[id://1|a node you considered] has been unconsidered due to the
number of keep votes.&lt;/em&gt;  It should probably also contain a link to
the consideration guidelines.  I'd like the choice to send a message
whenever I unconsider something (as I get with reparenting and editing).
&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: consideration guidelines are at 
[id://92975|92974].&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Editor's signature&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I paste in the same few lines every time I edit a node.  I'd like
to see a default signature (either one written by each editor, or
a generic one) in a seperate text box below the node I'm editing,
with a checkbox (by default selected) to include the signature.
Putting it in the textbox allows me to fill in the reason, and
perhaps the date, although it would be much nicer if the date were
automagically supplied.  Having the checkbox allows me to leave out
the signature, as I generally do when the author considered the node
her/himself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Multiple tasks in the same form&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Editing currently involves many, many reloads.  I'd like to see
some of the tasks combined in to the same form.  For example,
when editing a node, the 'submit' button could also include
an unconsider checkbox, and a message to the node author (with
a radio button to enable/disable sending it).  In this instance
the preview button would ignore everything other than the message
text, regardless of its values.  Another example is in ehomat:
there could be an option to unconsider the child node and message
the author of the child node on the same screen as 'does this look
right?' (naturally ignored if you opt for no).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anon authors excluded from default message sending&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If the author is anon, it would be nice not to have the default 
message displayed after editing.  I usually catch myself, but sometimes
I try to message anon when I've edited a node.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I do hope that some of these will be implemented, because it would
really reduce the amount of work for editors.  Right now I rarely
spend less than 15 minutes a day editing, and I only see the time
increasing :(
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;tye, 2002-05-24&lt;br/&gt;
I fixed several problems with the (apparently rather hastilly) reopened [Perl News] section.  There is one potentially ugly problem remaining...
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
Since the work to set up the (unduely complicated) "approval link type" and related baggage has not been done, you can't "approve" Perl News nodes. This means that the approval nodelet won't show. Which means that some ppl can move a node to Perl News after which only editors will be able to move it anywhere else. The best solution is probably to create all of the baggage and make Perl News items require approval.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
You have been warned.  Also, if this becomes a point of abuse before an enterprising [gods|god] gets around to adding "approval" for [Perl News], then the ability to move to/from [Perl News] can very quickly be taken away by deleting one line from [writeupmover].
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;B&gt;Update&lt;/B&gt; (26 Sep 2002): The node in question was unreaped by the new [footpad|demigod].  &lt;i&gt;--f&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;&lt;I&gt;[footpad] agrees with the [kudra|lady] and casts a second unreap vote&lt;/I&gt;, ~Sun May 19 03:38:00 2002 (GMT)&lt;/P&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[kudra], 2002-05-17&lt;br&gt;
In the thread [id://167147] I was introduced to 
[id://167109|a recently reaped node].  I'm of the opinion it shouldn't
have been reaped, and clearly several others people feel that way, judging
by some of the comments about it in the other thread.  I would suggest
reinstating the node as it appears there are enough people who would have
voted keep had they been around at the time.  (More on my thoughts
[id://167234|here].)

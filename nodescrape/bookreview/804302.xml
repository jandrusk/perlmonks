&lt;p&gt;Before i got this book i sometimes wondered how to solve given "sysadmin" tasks and if this is possible (or manageable for me) in perl ...&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To make a long story short this book really gave me a boost and i could solve some problems in only 2 weeks which i was thinking and trying many times before ...&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One of the most valuable Perl books, i must admit that i cant say much on linux automation since i almost only use win32 automation in Perl, but "only" the suggested Modules that kept me from searching for days to find the right tool for the task are worth the money for the book. &lt;br&gt;The Examples could be adjusted to my needs, i did only read a few chapters but already got many useful information which helps me alot. (Event Log Parsing for example)&lt;br&gt;
I so far found only a few minor "formatting" typos that i was able to correct with warnings on ... &lt;br&gt;
Overall i blame myself not to have bought this book earlier it would have spared me many errors in windows administration, alone the navigation through the module jungle ...
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

The only critics: That i would have liked more "sample code" on some for me more complicated topics like user management or WMI, here i would have expected a little more details it is again that i see the most hated sentence a writer could use &lt;b&gt;"This is beyond the scope of this book"&lt;/b&gt;. 
I think it could be a little better "indexed" sometimes i need too much time to find the right page in the book  ...
&lt;br&gt;Since i use Strawberry Perl and not Active Perl and cpan behind a firewall i had to do some work to get it run, would be fine if there would have been some tipps on using cpan with proxys/firewalls ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Book is not meant for the Beginner, so i have to do some basic work here and there since i am not a experienced programmer ... &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The Reader feels that the author is a gifted sysadmin &lt;b&gt;sharing his wisdom from practical experience and writing is a pleasure for him&lt;/b&gt; ...&lt;br&gt;

&lt;b&gt;I would give this book a rating of 4 out of 5 stars&lt;/b&gt;, cause of small "flaws"&lt;br&gt;
(I never gave a book 5 stars, cause no one writes books or me only, but this is so far the most useful book for me on perl  ;-).)&lt;br&gt;
I may adjust the review as i read more ...&lt;br&gt;

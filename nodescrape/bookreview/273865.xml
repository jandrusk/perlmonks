I really loved this book!  The authors seem extremely knowledgeable on both .NET and Perl.  I think that Perl is great, but I've always had a hard time using Tcl/Tk to do my GUI's.  I was a Java Programmer for over three years, and I used that extensively for my GUI's.  This book covers how to make GUI's for Perl using .NET very well.  Its nice because it uses a C# style to call all of the .NET components, so if you have any familiarity with Java, or C#, you will find this extremely helpful.

The book offers truly great insight on all of the aspects of programming in the .NET environment with Perl, covering basic Perl programming, Object-Oriented Perl programming, working with CPAN, Programming with PerlNET, working with and creating .NET components, working with the .NET framework with special emphasis on GUI, Database, and ASP.NET development.

I must put special recommendation on this book because the author Yevgeny Menaker has been so helpful guiding me thru, and that's refreshing!

SO, what are you waiting for?  Go buy this book pronto!</field>

This book ignores ALL CGI security issues including: &lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;the use of CGI.pm- it provides its own POST splitter which would mess up on the simplest of unwanted data and provide a potential area for bombing.It doesn't even mention it.
&lt;li&gt;Taint checking- doesn't even mention it. 
&lt;li&gt;the warning flag- doesn't even mention it.
&lt;/ul&gt;
Continuing on, it provides oversimplified examples of a "search engine" while not even explaining what happens when a CGI script is initiated. This book focuses alot more on HTML than it does on Perl! Supposedly written by "web professionals" that worked on commercial websites, I doubt that these guys actually wrote scripts in the same manner that they explain in the book. This is yet another perl dud. For the sake of Internet security, PLEASE DO NOT BUY OR USE THIS BOOK. 0 stars.</field>

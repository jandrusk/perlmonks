I bought this book because I thought it would be an excellent adition to Conway's book. In fact, this is what Amazon had to say:
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
This is the ultimate collection of ready-to-use code and expert techniques. Instant Perl Modules shows you, step-by-step, how to create your own Perl modules to extend the capabilities of this already flexible scripting language. Plus, you'll get more than 100 ready-to-run Perl modules on the bonus CD-ROM. 
&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
This book actually does nothing of the sort. It actually shows you how to use the OO methods of quite a few modules. It's rather like Lincoln Stein's Network Programming With Perl, in that it goes over (what was for me) very familiar territory -- the modules already on CPAN. There are sections that are taken, verbatim, from the POD of these modules.
&lt;p&gt;
I felt rather gypped.
&lt;p&gt;
So the actual "chapter" on creating modules is all of 1.5 &lt;b&gt;pages&lt;/b&gt; long and doesnt teach you &lt;i&gt;anything&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
I guess it is hard to find a good book on OO Perl... but keep looking. This isnt one of them.

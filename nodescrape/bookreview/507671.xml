Chapters six and seven seem to go hand and hand as one reviews database and data set testing and the other covers website and backend testing. I really appreciate the ideas that chapter six presents about database and data set testing. It doesn't just stop at testing connections and such but also goes into mock databases, temporary databases and writing wrappers for extending testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Chapter seven goes into testing websites in the same fashion that chapter six covers testing databases. My only gripe is that it doesn't go too deeply into backend testing. The frontend testing is fairly comprehensive and it gives a lot of example on using WWW::Mechanize and other toolkits to efficiently recreate user experience. It also talks lightly about page validation. Toward the end of the chapter it gives a lot of detail on running a test server using Apache::Test and being able to really localize all of your web server and page testing. This is great because it allows you to do basic load and resource testing as well as keeping all of the build and testing of a web service completely separate from production areas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Chapter 8 tries to cover object oriented testing with Test::Class. This is a relatively different way of testing compared to the styles and standards presented in Test::Simple or Test::More. This presents some very interesting views on object and class testing inheritance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

Chapter 9 cleans up by discussing practical ideas on writing testable code and programs. One thing that I found nice was that it touched shared library testing and interactive program testing.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

I find this book very useful because of its practical example and reinforcement of good testing standards. It has become a solid reference for quick tips on test unit creation, testing methods in general, and test coverage testing. I recommend it for anyone who is looking to start working with more focused testing or want to expanding there current testing knowledge in general.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

I'm not a programmer, but an EE. However I found Perl to be 
very useful to me in cutting down mechanical chores.
I tried the Camel book, but being new to UNIX and
to Perl, I couldn't understand the explanations, which
were refrenced to something quiet obvious (not to me).
I bought the Black Book, and found it to be very complete and easy
to understand. The system guys in the company where
I work, said that it contains more information on Perl than any 
other book they've seen. Including the camel book (yeah
I know, it's blasphemy).As Kelly Bundy used to say: Ina butt
shell, excellent buy and a rival to the Camel book, and in some 
issues, tops it.</field>

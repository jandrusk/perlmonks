This is a good and quick intro to Perl if you need to get up to speed before the end of this week. It has lots of short examples in it. Though the intended user is running a Unix/Linux machine, I've used most of the examples on Windows.  At $11.75 for coilbound (lays flat on the desk) or eBook for $0.95 it is a deal. Look the book up on lulu.com</field>

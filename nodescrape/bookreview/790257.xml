Review of first edition at perlmonks.


&lt;p&gt;
The first edition (published in 2000) was titled
&lt;br/&gt;
Perl for System Administration,
&lt;br/&gt;
Managing Multiplatform Environments with Perl.


&lt;p&gt;
The second edition has 50% more pages,
four more chapters,
and two more appendices.

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Code was tested by the author
with Perl 5.8.8 and ActivePerl (5.8.8) 822.

&lt;p&gt;
Code was built with 'use strict', but that is not shown in samples.



&lt;p&gt;
This is a brief review, based on scanning through the book
and reading two chapters and several other sections.
I have used the first edition, and was
pleased to find that it was revised and expanded to
include more data about more modern Perl modules.


&lt;p&gt;
This book
provides in-depth coverage
of how to automate several aspects of SA work
with Perl.
At one level,
it is a tour of 
a wide variety of CPAN modules for the busy SA,
by a very experienced and knowledgeable guide.



&lt;p&gt;
The author provides much experience-based data
concerning the problems being solved
and various Perl modules and techniques
that can be employed.
The data in this book can help you to avoid
expensive mistakes;
or at least be prepared to
handle such issues.

&lt;p&gt;
For example,
the section on page 507 points out some benefits of using
GD::Graph, and also a possible drawback, ie,
it requires
multiple levels of dependencies to be built and installed.

&lt;p&gt;
To avoid this issue,
he offers several alternatives,
such as
&lt;br/&gt;
seeking a prebuilt package of GD::Graph
for your system;
&lt;br/&gt;
using a different package,
(eg, one of the textual
presentation tools described on the previous pages,
like Text::Autoformat);
&lt;br/&gt;
remote controlling some other dedicated graphing
program (eg, gnuplot);
&lt;br/&gt;
using the
more powerful and complex RRD tool,
described in the
following section.

&lt;p&gt;
The author follows this paradigm throughout the book:
describing a problem
and a range of tools that can be used
to solve it,
and going into
enough depth so that you can make an informed
judgment about
where to spend your time when faced with 
a similar problem:
&lt;br/&gt;
search CPAN for data about these and other modules that 
could help;
&lt;br/&gt;
or start with the tools and
approach that he described in detail
and apply them to your situation.

&lt;p&gt;
Another example: in Chapter 13,
he chooses nemesis 
as a network packet builder.
He mentions several alternative tools
and also lists the reasons for his choice:
the package has been well-maintained and has
good
multiplatform support.
However,
it relies on libnet 1.0.2,
an older release that might not be on your system.
You might have to handle this configuration
problem before being able to use the tool.
The note includes a link to a web page that covers
the issue.


&lt;p&gt;
The end of each chapter 
contains a list of the Perl modules that were covered,
and an annotated bibliography
of relevant documents and web pages.

&lt;p&gt;
The seven appendices,
are short tutorials with basic data
about some of the technologies used in the book.
These are valuable if you are new
to the topic,
or
if you have not worked in that area recently.




&lt;p&gt;
There are many gems of insight throughout the book,
especially in the highlighted sidebars, notes,
warnings, and even footnotes, eg, 
"Friends don't let friends use Access
as a multiuser database." p.75.

&lt;p&gt;
I only found one possible typo in my reading,
and there was only one errata noted at the 
publisher's site for the book.

&lt;p&gt;
I can offer one suggestion: 
emphasize the valuable sidebars.
They often give a flavor of the issues that you
might face when
working with the technology being described.

Some of the sidebar titles are relevant,
while others are not descriptive of the content.
Rename the titles that need it,
and list all the titles in the table of contents.


&lt;p&gt;
The author seems to enjoy writing, and he does it well.
There is more than a little humor,
which appears natural and
not contrived.
The technical content here is wide and deep,
and is presented effectively.

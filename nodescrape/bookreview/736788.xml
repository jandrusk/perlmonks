Who should be interested in this book?
&lt;br&gt;
If you would want to go from being a Perl dabbler to a Perl programmer. Intermediate Perl will teach you how to use Perl as a programming language not just a scripting language.
&lt;br&gt;
- from the back cover of this O'reilly book.

&lt;br&gt;
Personally I recommend this book to those readers, who would want to continue learning Perl after reading the 'learning perl' book.
To me all the topics were helpful, maintains a good tutorial-istic approach, The chapter about 'testing' serves a good introduction to testing Perl modules.

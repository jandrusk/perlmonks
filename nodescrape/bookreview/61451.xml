&lt;p&gt;This book provides a fairly brief (268 pages including appendices) guided tour of most of perl's basic features, including hashes, arrays, regular expressions, file manipulation, file handles, process management and even a chapter on CGI programming.

&lt;p&gt;Many, many people (I'm in that group too!) have gotten started with perl using this book, so it absolutely works as a tutorial. The exercises (with detailed solutions) are good and really help you to solidify your knowledge at the end of each chapter. 

&lt;p&gt;The book suffers a little because it was originally written for UNIX. There are several UNIX-type solutions and paradigms used. This isn't necessarily bad, rather it may not be the optimal approach when teaching people who work with Win32. 

&lt;p&gt;The book could have been improved by more information on the Win32 modules, Windows administration and networking and possibly by the deletion of the DBM chapter. 

&lt;p&gt;To summarize briefly: if you are using NT and starting to learn perl, this is the book you need. However, there are some rough edges when it comes to the coverage of Win32-specific parts of perl.</field>

This is a book on software testing and the test process. It is aimed at a person working in QA, but would be a very good read for anyone having to develop a log term testing strategy at a company or group level.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
I have to tell off the bat that I think it's one of the best book ever written on the subject.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
The Authors Cem Kaner ([http://www.kaner.com/]), James Bach ([http://blackbox.cs.fit.edu/blog/james/] and  [http://www.satisfice.com/]), and Bret Pettichord ([http://www.pettichord.com/]) are believers that there are not 'best practices' for testing but only 'appropriate practices'. This is called "Context Based testing'. In a way this ties in the Perl philosophy of getting the job done. 
&lt;BR&gt;
Examples of chapters titles are&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
"thinking like a tester", &lt;BR&gt;
"Bug advocacy", &lt;BR&gt;
"interacting with programmers",&lt;BR&gt;
"test design strategy"&lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
Each chapter is broken into short lessons, about 15 per chapters. The advice is a high level and give you the mental framework to solve your own issues. &lt;BR&gt;
&lt;BR&gt;
I've been testing for a few years now. Each lesson I read rang true to my experiences. It gets you back to the actual job of testing rather then getting lost in process. They treat testing a a scientific process rather then a bureaucratic one. 
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Many years ago James Back wrote an article that changed the way I think of testing &lt;BR&gt;
"Exploratory Testing" ([http://www.satisfice.com/articles/et-article.pdf]). After that I read everything I could find by him.
&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;
Bret Pettichord give a course call "Homebrew Test Automation" we he uses Ruby to teach test automation without using commercial tools.

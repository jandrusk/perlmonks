After hashing through a few introductory texts, and purchasing &lt;a href ="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=169417"&gt;Programming Perl&lt;/a&gt;. I decided to purchase 'Professional Perl Developement' after scanning through it and reading a couple of its pages in a shop. Its quite a large book, and I still have a long way to go before I've read it all. I found the CGI stuff well written, and a good introduction for me, so much so that I'm already writing some useful applications. I also found the LWP chapters very useful and well written. So a thumbs up for the web sections (from me anyhow). The Tk stuff was very good, the examples all worked for me, and I found it a great introduction. Its given me a taster for Tk, and I've just ordered &lt;a href="http://perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=144517"&gt;Mastering Perl/Tk&lt;/A&gt; in the hopes that it can provide me with the higher level of detail that just couldn't be covered by the scope of this book.&lt;BR&gt;
Overall, well written, with good working examples, and a very useful edition in any Perl library. Maybe some other monk with more experience of databases, etc. would review some of the middle chapters that I'm missing out on. &lt;P&gt;
